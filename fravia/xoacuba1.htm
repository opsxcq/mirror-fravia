                           Cubase 3.0 UNDONGLED!

                      courtesy of +XoanoN/PiNNACLE 1997





Well, i have seen some of my previous works published by the +HCU.

And for me this is already enough... Wow! To be on &quot;the&quot; site together 

with the &quot;Gotha&quot; of cracking!!! So i decided to start working on a more 

serious project, a cracking subsector that only REAL +crackers can face: 

DONGLES!

Eh eh.... well, i have seen that the +HCU needs something about dongles, so 

why should I not try? Let's see....



Prologue:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, i decided to try this donglecrack 'coz i don't know of ANY

version of Cubase 3.0 working (i mean REAL 100% cracked). Maybe there are

newer versions out (i think 3.05 or more), but i'm not sure if are cracked

well, coz i haven't tried them.

And, the reason of this is quite simple: many crackers tend to not even 

trying out the programs once they THINK they've cracked them, and since 

Cubase has a funny trick (to let you think you've cracked it after less 

than 2 minutes of debugging... you got it?) I think it is worth explaining 

a little its protection schemes. By the way, i tried cracking it 1 year 

ago and did the same error. 

In more understandable terms, simply NOPPING a JNZ lets you bypass the 

initial donglecheck, so cubase &quot;runs&quot; somehow. But try working more than 

10 minutes (or even less)... try creating new tracks, by clicking 4 or

5 times on the right window... try choosing &quot;Score&quot; from the menu.... 

TRY ANYTHING!!! It will soon crash with a &quot;General Protection Failure&quot; 

error report...



Some donglecracking infos you may need:

--------------------------------------------------------------

Since dongles are a relatively &quot;strong&quot; way to protect a program (a dongle 

can contain locations where the program needs to jump, etc...) sometimes 

without them it's impossible to crack such protections... I mean, in some 

hard cases (i.e. when the locations of the jmps are stored *directly* 

inside the dongle) you'll need ABSOLUTELY the dongle, or you can't do 

anything... the program will not run.

In this case (and in other ones as well) first try to &quot;emulate&quot; the dongle, 

if you understand how it works. If you can't, then try a BRUTE FORCE 

approach (read my tutorial) to fool the program (as i did with Cubase). 

This is the way to proceed in order to &quot;bruteforcing&quot; a dongle:



1) Write down the locations where the program crashes/does not run

2) Trace back and try to locate the switches (jumps) which jump to these

   locations

3) Be sure these locations aren't used in other part of the program as well



Let's start!!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, are u ready with your Martini Vodka and/or cigarettes AND Softice???

Good...... let's begin eradicating the initial donglecheck!

(you could also try to emulate the dongle by setting BPIO -h on printer 

ports such as 0378/0379/037a etc... you will land in the CUBASE.VXD... 

and believe me... it's better to try another approach!)

Well, you run Cubase and it popsup with the classic &quot;Plug the dongle,idiot&quot;

screen.... Ah ah ah!! Simply rerun it, Ctrl-D before the nag appears, hit F12 

more than once to trace back calls (<FONT color="blue">p ret</FONT> is for sure one of the best 

SoftICE's functions i think, without it some of the hard cracks couldn't be 

done) and you'll land in the CUBASE30CM module. Step step and step until 

you reach this code (you might need to set some temporaneus BPX to get rid 

of cycles_loops, but you will figure out yourself where and how... otherwise 

i would spend a whole day writing this tutorial!):





*Initial Check



0013.3C36 6A00                   push 0000

0013.3C38 6A00                   push 0000

0013.3C3A 56                     push si

0013.3C3B 6A3F                   push 003F

0013.3C3D 6A00                   push 0000

0013.3C3F 90                     nop

0013.3C40 0E                     push cs

0013.3C41 E8A924                 call 60ED  <TRACING this call you will see how the dongle operates, you'll reach the VXD too. but you better don't consider it! Let's BRUTEFORCE! 0013.3C44 83C40A add sp, 000A 0013.3C47 8BF8 mov di, ax 0013.3C49 8BC7 mov ax, di 0013.3C4B 3DFEFF cmp ax, FFFE < CUBASE.386 not loaded 0013.3C4E 7421 je 3C71 0013.3C50 3DFFFF cmp ax, FFFF < AX="FFFF" ? Dongle not present 0013.3C53 7402 je 3C57 < NOPPING this lets you run Cubase... this is how most of the crackers THOUGHT they got rid of the protection. Moving in AX a value like 0000 doesn't work too, by the way. 0013.3C55 EB4D jmp 3CA4 Ok, now let's hexedit your NOPS in the CUBASESC.EXE to let the program run and start again. As you can see, trying the things i told you before makes your system crash at random times and you have to reboot and reload SoftICE (very very frustrating!). What can we do? Don't worry, +Xoanon explains! Well, you noticed that when your system crashes softice popsup and tells you WHERE the crashes happens, at which instructions. We see, for Cubase, that this happens here (btw, it happens here if you try to create more than 2 or 3 tracks doubleclicking on the right window... could happen also on other instructions): * SYSTEM CRASH * * Referenced by a CALL at Addresses: |:0015.529A, :0015.53F9, :0015.5487, :0015.5588, :0015.5CFB |:0015.5E1B, :0015.AB6B, :0015.AB85, :0015.AC01, :0015.B513 |:0015.B73F, :0015.B9AA, :0015.BA51 | :0015.C5C6 45 inc bp :0015.C5C7 55 push bp :0015.C5C8 8BEC mov bp, sp :0015.C5CA 83EC08 sub sp, 0008 :0015.C5CD C45E06 les bx, [bp+06] :0015.C5D0 66268B4704 mov eax, es:[bx+04] < Executing one of :0015.C5D5 668946FC mov [bp-04], eax these MOV the prg :0015.C5D9 C45E06 les bx, [bp+06] crashes.... :0015.C5DC 66268B07 mov eax, es:[bx] INTERESTING! :0015.C5E0 668946F8 mov [bp-08], eax :0015.C5E4 C45EFC les bx, [bp-04] :0015.C5E7 268A474A mov al , es:[bx+4A] :0015.C5EB 98 cbw :0015.C5EC A809 test al, 09 :0015.C5EE 755A jne C64A :0015.C5F0 C45EFC les bx, [bp-04] :0015.C5F3 268A4735 mov al , es:[bx+35] So, this can be our "ENTRY POINT" !!! Reboot (ARGH!), reload and try to locate in memory the instructions at C5C6. This could be a little hard coz the program relocate everytime... Try doubleclicking to create a track AND pressing CTRL-D immediately (right after doubleclicking), now trace back, with F12, and try U cs:C5C6 until you see the following instructions... you could also need some stepping inside the code "of.class" tppabs="http://fravia.org/of.class" CUBASECM in order to find them. Or maybe you could try to find them in memory, with the search function. Hmm.... ok,ok... i already did it for you... i don't want you to stay awake the whole night trying to locate a "labile" instruction! Do the following: 1) Double click to create a track, and immediately CTRL-D 2) Do HEAP CUBSCM30 to see how the memory is occupied by Cubase 3) The correct handle is the one with: Lenght: 0000EBC0 Type: Code (obvious) Seg/Resrc: 0F 4) To be sure, do U ^THIS HANDLE^:C5C6 to see if it refers to the INC BP 5) If it doesn't, maybe that segment isn't loaded in memory yet... simply retry once more from step 1. Once found (hard eh?) set a BPX on the INC BP instruction and CTRl-D to reenter in Cubase. Try to create more tracks and..... BOOM! Softice breaks at your BPX! This is interesting... we see that this piece of code is called ONLY when Cubase decides to crash your system. Therefore we can try to find a "switch" in order to bypass it. Ok, now begins the real hard work... . STACK to see which calls are executed right before your BPX CUBSCM30(10) at 331F:019C [?] CUBSCM30(10) at 331F:0A41 [?] CUBSCM30(10) at 331F:AA9D [?] < This is the call WHICH got us> CUBSCM30 (0F) at 3327:c5c6    <HERE! Hmmm..... well, unfortunately we have to reboot again now.... but we found something REALLY REALLY interesting! The CALL which lead us to the "crash" routine. Immediately reboot and light a cigarette/sip a Martini Vodka, 'coz we are near the "clue"! Rebooted? ok! Reload and find in memory again the segment as i showed you before, but now set a BPX at AA9D. Once doubleclicking etc.... you'll break here: :0015.AA9D E85F0B call B5FF < This is the call which crashes your system :0015.AAA0 83C404 add sp, 0004 :0015.AAA3 5F pop di :0015.AAA4 5E pop si :0015.AAA5 C9 leave Hmm.... now a little zen: we found a call which crashes our systems.... so let's walk some instructions back until we find something (a JNZ/JZ/etc) which JUMPS OVER this evil call. Back back back back back back..... Found!!!!! :0015.AA8C 9AFFFF0000 call 0012.939Fh :0015.AA91 3D0200 cmp ax, 0002 :0015.AA94 7512 jne AAA8 < as we see, it jumps over our "evil call" :0015.AA96 16 push ss :0015.AA97 8D46BE lea ax, [bp-42] :0015.AA9A 50 push ax If you examine yourself how the program works, you'll find soon that the JNE above JUMPS when AX not="2..." maybe the dongle just checks something (or may be something is stored in some locations by the initial check with the VXD), and when AX="2" it executes the CALL at AA9D and it fucks up our target. Well, we can try this right now (a simple changing the JNE in JMP will not work, coz at AAA8 there is another check as you will see). :0015.AAA8 C746AE0000 mov word ptr [bp-52], 0000 :0015.AAAD 9AFFFF0000 call 0012.796Dh :0015.AAB2 250300 and ax, 0003 :0015.AAB5 3D0200 cmp ax, 0002 < if it's 2 will crash :0015.AAB8 7508 jne AAC2 :0015.AABA C7064C680300 mov word ptr [684C], 0003 :0015.AAC0 EB35 jmp AAF7 So, try changing the CMP AX,002 in MOV AX,002 at AA91 (and also the following JNE in JMP) this will work.... YEAH! We did it!!!! Hmm... are we sure? Lets reboot and try some other options... We see that we can create as much tracks as we want, we click all over the screen and nothing happens... So? nice, yet... try to choose something from the menus, say the Score Editor... it might work 1,2,3,4,5 and may be some more times...yet it will surely crash again! And at a different location... Well, at this point i thought i was lost too.... there are a lot of locations where the programs crashes, this seems as it would be a very long cracking session to change them all... let's give up... But... i never surrend! Let's go back to the code "at.class" tppabs="http://fravia.org/at.class" AA91. There will SURELY be a place where the CMP is done a first time, and destroying it should let all the others compare passages work right. Therefore... zen again: search back from AA91 until we find an instruction which JUMPS OVER! Examine again the AA91 part, BUT now, looking at some previous instructions, we find: :0015.AA76 E92A0B jmp B5A3 < INTERESTING!!!! :0015.AA79 668B4690 mov eax, [bp-70] :0015.AA7D 668946C2 mov [bp-3E], eax :0015.AA81 C45E06 les bx, [bp+06] :0015.AA84 2680BFAC0001 cmp byte ptr es:[bx+00AC], 01 :0015.AA8A 751C jne AAA8 :0015.AA8C 9AFFFF0000 call 0012.939Fh :0015.AA91 3D0200 cmp ax, 0002 :0015.AA94 7512 jne AAA8 As we see, this part starts with a JMP.... what does this mean? It means that the code at AA79 (which contains our CMP AX,002 etc...) is CALLED (or jumped to) by some other instructions. This means also that we MIGHT search for some "CALL AA79" or "JNZ/JZ/etc. AA79". Ok, let's try examining the code back, starting from this point. Back back back back back back and...... FOUND!!!!! :0015.A9B5 9AFFFF0000 call 0012.7470h :0015.A9BA 83C402 add sp, 0002 :0015.A9BD 0BC0 or ax, ax :0015.A9BF 0F84B600 je AA79 :0015.A9C3 C45E06 les bx, [bp+06] :0015.A9C6 2680BFAC0001 cmp byte ptr es:[bx+00AC], 01 :0015.A9CC 0F85A900 jne AA79 As we can see, there are 2 JE/JNE which refers to AA79!!! Examining how the program act when it crashes, we found that every time it does, it jumps. So, what's better than nopping both the jumps? Well, it's enough to NOP the first one! THE END! Change your bytes in the file, reload it and .... NOW EVRYTHING WORKS! Happy sequencing with the best in MIDI programs! DONGLES?
