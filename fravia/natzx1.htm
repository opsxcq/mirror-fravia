A) INTRODUCTION





Welcome to my first Cracking Tutorial... I will try to write more

Essays and Tutorials in the Future.

I could have made more in the past, but i was afraid that anybody could read

my BAD English ;) so please excuse me and just try to follow me below.



LEVEL :		

Well, I will try to give you all Informations and document all my Steps 

and Listings, so maybe also a Beginner will be able to understand this

Tutorial (maybe ;).



TARGET :		Our Target is Cakewalk HomeStudio from Twelve Tone Systems ,



			The compressed File size (only really necessary parts) is 

                        only 536 KB



PROTECTION :	This Application has 3 Protection layers.



			1.CD-CHECK

			2.CD-KEY

			3.SERIAL



__________________________



B) TOOLS YOU NEED





			You will need the following Tools:



			- SoftICE 3.x from Numega		 

                          (The best Debugger. Big Thanx to Numega)

			- W32Dasm 8.9  from URSoft		 

                          (I love References) 				)

			- Hex-Workshop or any other Hex-Editor   

                          (Yeah, gimme the Bytes location)

			- Icompx the InstallSHIELD de/compressor 

                          (Thanx to Lord Caligo that has put it on his Page)

			- A Wodka-Martini if you are a +Cracker and/or a cigarette ;)



			You can get most tools from Lord Caligo¥s Web-Page.

                        One of the best Cracking Resource i have ever seen!

C) WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH





			After unzipping into C:/TEMP, we get the following ones:



			_SETUP.LIB		151	KB

			SETUP.EXE		659	KB

			_SETUP.DLL		5,98	KB

			SETUP.INS		89,5	KB

			SETUP.PKG		Not important



			(There are a lot more files in the complete App, I got a

                         stripped one)



			Let me first explain what we have here.



These are the typical Files from a InstallSHIELD Installation. 



_SETUP.LIB is a compressed Data-Base from InstallSHIELD. 

It can contain exe¥s and dll¥s supporting the Installation.

Sometimes these Support Files are in the same dir like SETUP.EXE

(unlikely), but in our case they are compressed into _SETUP.LIB

(You will see and understand later).

			

What I didn't get was the compressed Data-Base Files (xxx.1-x,xxx.z) 			

containing the App Files and so they can be very big ;).

			

Don¥t mind it, because we dont need them anyway for cracking.

A compressed Data-Base File allways begins with &quot;13 5D 65 8C 3A 01 02 00&quot;,

so if you cant find any xxx.z or xxx.1-x then just look for these bytes.



At the End of every compressed Data-Base File you can see all the File Names, 

by the way.

			

SETUP.PKG contains all the File-Names in the App Data-Base which we

dont need and so we dont need SETUP.PKG either.

			

InstallSHIELD uses SETUP.PKG to refer the Files in the App Data-Base in 

the copying process i believe. Anyway, we dont need it, so lets go on.



_SETUP.DLL is a InstallSHIELD Resource DLL and its not important for 

us, because its only a Support File which is supplied with any

InstallSHIELD Installation.

			

SETUP.INS is the compiled Installation Script and its the most important 

Part in a InstallSHILED Installation Process! 

In Win95 it has got a globe connected to a phone as icon. 

This File Controls any Action and has got most of the messages of the 

Installation and it will play a major Role in our SECOND APPROACH.

			

SETUP.EXE is the head of all, it is the Installation Engine and

executes the Script and does all calls to DLL¥s and Disk-Access (32 Bit!).



So far so good, now we know a lot more about InstallSHIELD =)



			Lets start with the....





__________________________



D) FIRST APPROACH



(CD-CHECK)



ASSUMPTION :	I assume the following things under SoftICE :



			F5=&quot;^x;&quot;

			F7=&quot;^here;&quot;

			F8=&quot;^t;&quot;

			F9=&quot;^bpx;&quot;

			F10=&quot;^p;&quot;

			F11=&quot;^G @SS:ESP;&quot;

			F12=&quot;^p ret;&quot;



			Also the winice.dat File in your SoftICE dir should contain :



			EXP=c:\windows\system\kernel32.dll

			EXP=c:\windows\system\user32.dll



HINT :		&quot;*&quot; in Front of the Text coming up means, that the text into

brackets must be typed under SoftICE!





START :	Ok, now lets get to business and start cracking.

	First we just start the Istallation (SETUP.EXE) and see whats happening.

	Well, a MessageBox tells us, that &quot;Setup must be run from the original CD&quot;.

	Our next logical step now should be setting a Breakpoint on

	GetDriveTypeA (&quot;A&quot; coz SETUP.EXE is a 32 Bit App).

	Have a look at part G) WIN32.HLP of this tutorial to get more info

	about GetDriveType!



*	We press Crtl+D and SoftICE pops up and then we type in 

        &quot;BPX GetDriveTypeA&quot;

*	Pressing &quot;Crtl+D&quot; (&quot;F5&quot;) gets us back to Windows, where we start

        Setup.exe again.

	Ok, we are in SoftICE before the MessageBox appears.

	We are in the Kernel32 at GetDriveTypeA, so lets get out of here

*	by pressing &quot;F11&quot; one time. And now we are in INSHELP, damn! whats 

        that ? It wasnt in our dir !!

*	Well i typed in &quot;MOD INSHELP&quot; to get more info about this file

	and SoftICE shows me, that its located in :



	C:\TEMP\_ISTMP0.DIR\INSHELP.DLL



	Now we see that it¥s a DLL and that IstallSHIELD has created a

        Temporary directory called _ISTMP0.DIR and then it puts the file

        INSHELP.DLL in there. 

        But where does this File come from ?

			

        Ok, maybe you dont have forgotten what i told you in C) about

	compressed Data-Bases ? Yes ? Then you should read it again now!

	So this DLL must be in _SETUP.LIB, but how should we patch it ?

	Well we got ICOMPX the InstallSHIELD de/compressor ;)

	Let¥s decompress _SETUP.LIB (&quot;ICOMP _SETUP.LIB *.* -d -i&quot;)

	These Files we will get :



		INSHELP.DLL

		UNINST.EXE

		_ISRES.DLL



	The last two files are only support Files and not important for us.

	What we know now is that INSHELP.DLL makes the CD-CHECK and that it is

	in _SETUP.LIB which we can decompress and then compress again.

	By the way you may just type in &quot;ICOMP&quot; to get the full usage.

	Now that we got all infos about this File and how to patch it lets

	go on with SoftICE¥ing ;).

	We are still in INSHELP.DLL, so let me give you the listing first :

	Your adresses may differ in the first four diggits ! (relocation)

	And SoftICE pops up at 100011A0 (0) , so go there now!



DWORD TABLE:



:10001308 BA120010 DWORD 100012BA	These are the DWORDS for the indirect jmps

:1000130C C7120010 DWORD 100012C7	I have place them here coz it will be

:10001310 D4120010 DWORD 100012D4	easier for you to follow me ;)

:10001314 E1120010 DWORD 100012E1

:10001318 EE120010 DWORD 100012EE

:1000131C B0110010 DWORD 100011B0

:10001320 FB120010 DWORD 100012FB



Start of this routine:



:10001160 81ECE8020000	  sub esp, 000002E8			Create a temporary Stack-Frame

:10001166 B9FFFFFFFF	  mov ecx, FFFFFFFF			ecx=FFFFFFFF (counter)

:1000116B 2BC0		  sub eax, eax				eax=0

:1000116D 56		  push esi				Save esi

:1000116E 57		  push edi				Save edi

:1000116F 8BBC24F4020000  mov edi, [esp + 000002F4]		edi points to &quot;C:\TEMP\&quot;

:10001176 F2		  repnz

:10001177 AE		  scasb					Scan String for 0 (end)

:10001178 F7D1		  not ecx					ecx=lenght+1=9

:1000117A 2BF9		  sub edi, ecx				Adjust edi back

:1000117C 8BC1		  mov eax, ecx				Save lenght in eax

:1000117E C1E902	  shr ecx, 02				Divide lenght by 4 =2

:10001181 8BF7		  mov esi, edi				esi=edi=ptr to &quot;C:\TEMP\&quot;

:10001183 8D7C2448	  lea edi, [esp + 48]	 <EDI="ptr" to [esp+48] :10001187 F3 repz | :10001188 A5 movsd | Copy "C:\TEMP\" to *edi :10001189 8BC8 mov ecx, eax | ecx="eax=lenght" :1000118B 83E103 and ecx, 00000003 | ecx="mod" 9/4="1" :1000118E F3 repz | :1000118F A4 movsb | Copy last byte(s) :10001190 C644244B00 mov [esp + 4B], 00 |------- "C:\TEMP\" :10001195 8D4C2448 lea ecx, [esp + 48] <------ "C:\"="RootPathName" :10001199 51 push ecx Handle it to GetDriveTypeA * Reference To: KERNEL32.GetDriveTypeA, Ord:00CEh | :1000119A FF15E0900010 Call dword ptr [100090E0] This calls GetDriveTypeA (return: eax="Type)" :100011A0 83F806 cmp eax, 00000006 <------ (0) SoftICE breaks in here ! :100011A3 0F8704010000 ja 100012AD (1) :100011A9 FF248508130010 jmp dword ptr [4*eax + 10001308] (2) :100011B0 8D442414 lea eax, [esp + 14] (3) :100011B4 6A32 push 00000032 FileSystemNameSize :100011B6 8D4C2414 lea ecx, [esp + 14] :100011BA 50 push eax lpFileSystemNameBuffer :100011BB 8D542414 lea edx, [esp + 14] :100011BF 51 push ecx lpFileSystemFlags :100011C0 8D442414 lea eax, [esp + 14] :100011C4 52 push edx lpMaximumComponentLength :100011C5 8D8C2420010000 lea ecx, [esp + 00000120] :100011CC 50 push eax lpVolumeSerialNumber :100011CD 8D54245C lea edx, [esp + 5C] :100011D1 68C8000000 push 000000C8 VolumeNameSize :100011D6 51 push ecx lpVolumeNameBuffer :100011D7 52 push edx lpRootPathName ("C:\") Ok, we are right after the GetDrivetypeA call. Let us first figure out what will happen if we trace further. (1) This conditional jmp will never happen if i can trust on the Description of GetDriveType. (2) My eax is 3 (Hard-Disk) so this ptr will be 3*4+10001308="10001314" so this jmp would lead us to 100012E1 (see the DWORD TABLE above !) :100012E1 33C0 xor eax, eax Set eax to 0 :100012E3 5F pop edi Restore edi from stack :100012E4 5E pop esi Restore esi from stack :100012E5 81C4E8020000 add esp, 000002E8 Delete temporary Stack-Frame :100012EB C20400 ret 0004 return Well it seems that EAX="0" stands for BAD BOY ;) Cracking this CD-CHECK could end here just by patching the instructions at the Start of this routine (10001160)... Original: :10001160 81ECE8020000 sub esp, 000002E8 Create a temporary Stack-Frame :10001166 B9FFFFFFFF mov ecx, FFFFFFFF ecx="FFFFFFFF" :1000116B 2BC0 sub eax, eax eax="0" :1000116D 56 push esi Save esi :1000116E 57 push edi Save edi Change to: :10001160 33C0 xor eax,eax eax="0" :10001162 40 inc eax eax="eax+1=1" GOOD BOY :10001163 C20400 ret 0004 Return Search for "81ECE8020000" in INSHELP.DLL with your Hex-Editor. You will only find one location (Offset 560). Replace the bytes with "33C040C20400" and save it. Ok, and now compress it back into _SETUP.LIB. Just type in "icomp inshelp.dll _setup.lib" and dont delete INSHELP.DLL, because we will need it again later ;) Do you want to know what this CD-CHECK would do further on ? If not just go over to the (CD-KEY) Section below! Hmmm, so you wanna learn more about CD-CHECKS ;) OK * What we do now is setting eax to 5 by typping in "r eax="5&quot;" then the jmp will bring us to dptr[5*4+10001308]="dptr[1000131C]=100011B0" which means we are right after the jmp itself ! at (3) The instructions after (3) just pushes all the infos for the GetVolumeInformationA call at 100011D8. * Reference To: KERNEL32.GetVolumeInformationA, Ord:013Ah | :100011D8 FF15DC900010 Call dword ptr [100090DC] This calls GetVolumeInformation :100011DE 85C0 test eax, eax Do we got all infos? :100011E0 0F8481000000 je 10001267 (4) if yes goto 10001267 :100011E6 8D842410010000 lea eax, [esp + 00000110] Volume Name ("HD_C") * Possible StringData Ref from Data Obj>&quot;CWHS_601&quot;

:10001210 EB05			jmp 10001217



		To continue our tracing session you have to nop out the Bad jmps !

*		Trace to the jmps &quot;F10&quot; and then &quot;a&quot; with two &quot;nop&quot;¥s.

		(4) This jmp will only occure if Setup is running from the original CD-Rom.

		     It then just bypasses the Volume and Filetype Check.



		I also suggest that you read part F) of this Tutorial to get more and

		detailed infos about GetVolumeInformation (FileSytemFlags) !!



		Ok, now comes the part the (5) Bad jmps will jump to....

:10001035 C3		ret				Return



	Setup calls a Sub in INSHELP while initialisation, which sets the 

        dword [10006030] to 1!



	OK, we just have learned something more about CD-Protections under

        Windows95 ;)

<font color="blue">

		- INSHELP first checks if setup is running from a CD-ROM.

		- Then it checks the Volume Name and the File System.

		- And at least it just checks for a specific File &quot;setup.lib&quot;.

		- After all INSHELP will return &quot;1&quot; for OK and &quot;0&quot; for Error!

</font>

	This CD-CHECK is defeated, now lets face the....





(CD-KEY)



	Ok, the MessageBox never appears now, we get a Welcome Window instead ;)

	We get an Edit area and a Text telling us to enter the 13 digit CD-KEY, brbrb.

	We type in &quot;1234567890123&quot; and then i set a Breakpoint on

*	GetWindowTextA : &quot;BPX GetWindowTextA&quot;.

	After pressing the NEXT-&gt; Button SoftICE pops up, this is easy hehe ;)

*	We are in GetWindowTextA so lets get back to the App and press &quot;F11&quot;.

	I looked at EAX, because it allways contains the Text lenght

	GetWindowTextA returns,

	but hell!! this isnt the lengh of my Text and so this cannot be my Text =(, brb.



	Dont worry, this is just a little trick to prevent Beginners to crack it.

	There are lotta other App out there using this trick btw !



	Setup uses GetWindowTextA to retrieves our input, but it does not wait 

        for the user pressing NEXT-&gt;, it just gets the text anytime we type in

        a single letter,



*	so lets first disable our Breakpoint : &quot;BD 0&quot;,

	and then we type in &quot;12345678901234&quot; and then we enable our Breakpoint:



*	&quot;BE 0&quot;.(dont forget to leave SoftICE)

	So, now comes the truth. I just deleted the last number with back-space

	and BOOM! yeah we are in GetWindowTextA again so lets leave here



*	again by pressing &quot;F11&quot;.

	Well, this looks much better, because EAX=0D=13, yeah our Key-lenght ;)

	We are in Setup by the way. Right after the Call GetWindowTextA

	there is a &quot;LEA EAX,[EBP+FFFFFBF4]&quot; which will let EAX points to our Text,

*	so trace over it with &quot;F8&quot; or &quot;F10&quot;.

*		Do a &quot;D EAX&quot; and you will see our text &quot;1234567890123&quot; !!

*		ok lets delete our Breakpoint, because we got what we wanted : &quot;BC *&quot;.



	And now we set a Breakpoint on Memory Access on our text loaction :

*	&quot;BPM EAX&quot;. Ok, exit SoftICE and it will fast pop up again.

	SoftICE will break into different locations, but the one that is important 

        for us is the lstrcpyA.

	You will land in there at the following instructions :



			...	............

			REPNZ	SCASB		        SoftICE will break in here!

			NOT	ECX

			MOV	ESI,[EBP+0C]		This is our old location

			MOV	EDI,[EBP+08]		This will be our new location

			...	............





	So, if you see these instructions you can delete your old breakpoint,

*	trace over the 2 MOVS with &quot;F8&quot; and then set a new Breakpoint on EDI:

*	&quot;BPM EDI&quot;. Otherwise just leave SoftICE until you are back in the

	Installation Window. Press NEXT-&gt; and you will break into lstrcpyA

	several times again, but now dont delete the old Breakpoints,

	just set the new ones on EDI after the 2 MOVS like before,

	until you are in INSHELP!! yeah its the same dll ;).

	Let me give you the listing first and consider again that the first

	four digits of the adresses may differ from yours under SoftICE (relocation).



	SoftICE will break in at 10001377!



Start of this routine:



:10001350 83EC34		sub esp, 00000034		Create a temporary Stack-Frame

:10001353 53			push ebx			Save ebx

:10001354 56			push esi			Save esi

:10001355 57			push edi			Save edi

:10001356 E8D5FCFFFF		call 10001030			Was this routine initialysed ?

:1000135B 85C0			test eax, eax			Check ok ? (It will be)

:1000135D 750B			jne 1000136A			then goto 1000136A, else

:1000135F 33C0			xor eax, eax			Set eax=0 BAD BOY!

:10001361 5F			pop edi				Restore edi

:10001362 5E			pop esi				Restore esi

:10001363 5B			pop ebx				Restore ebx

:10001364 83C434		add esp, 00000034		Delete temporary Stack-Frame

:10001367 C20400		ret 0004			Return



	Well it seems that EAX=0 stands for BAD BOY again like in the CD-Check!

	Cracking this CD-KEY could end here just by patching the instructions

	at the Start of this routine (10001350)...

	Dont patch it yet, if you wanna learn how to reverse ingineer this

        KEY-Protection!!



Original:

:10001350 83EC34	sub esp, 00000034		Create a temporary Stack-Frame

:10001353 53		push ebx			Save ebx

:10001354 56		push esi			Save esi

:10001355 57		push edi			Save edi

:10001356 E8D5FCFFFF	call 10001030			Was this routine initialysed ?



Change to:

:10001350 33C0		xor eax,eax			eax=0

:10001352 40		inc eax				eax=eax+1=1 GOOD BOY

:10001353 C20400	ret 0004			Return





	Search for &quot;83EC34535657&quot; in INSHELP.DLL with your Hex-Editor.

	You will only find one location (Offset 750). 

        Replace the bytes with &quot;33C040C20400&quot; and save it.

	Ok, and now compress it back into _SETUP.LIB.

	Just type in &quot;icomp inshelp.dll _setup.lib&quot; and dont delete INSHELP.DLL,

	because we will need it again later ;)

	And now any KEY you type in will be valid, cool heh =)

I mean where the final check occures!. This will happen at line (18) 100013F4. Here ecx must be D050. Now lets go back to the previous line. Here ecx will be subtracted by E11 the App-ID, this means ecx must be D050+E11="DE61" at this point!! Now let us see what the instructions at (16) does ! Well, let me first extract the few lines from 100013C8 100013EB into a more comfortable format for you : (1000,100 and 10 are in decimal ; numbers are in asc-II!) ecx="(" ( (1. number) * 10 + 4. number ) * 10 ) + 5. number ) * 10 ) + 6. number After simplification we get : ecx="1." number * 1000 + 4. number *100 + 5. number *10 + 6. number Hmm, now we know how ecx is calculated, but whats D050 ? Well, if we typed in "0"="48=30h" as our 1.,4.,5. and 6. number, then we will get : ecx="30h" * 1000d + 30h * 100d + 30h * 10d + 30h="D050!" And now consider that E11 h="3601" d="3" * 1000d + 6 * 100d + 0 * 10d + 1! Now guess what our 4 numbers are ;)! Yes, thats right... the 1st number must be 3! the 4th number must be 6! the 5th number must be 0! and the 6th number must be 1! So our KEY is build like this "3xx601xxxxxxx" ,hehe! Ok, lets look back before (16) (14) This will call a sub at 10001440 which will calculate a code with our KEY. (15) This code will be compared with E7B37! If this compare fails we will land at (20) 1000142D BAD BOY! Let us first examine the sub which generates the code... :10001440 56 push esi Save esi :10001441 33D2 xor edx, edx edx="0" :10001443 57 push edi Save edi :10001444 33C9 xor ecx, ecx ecx="0," this will be our char position counter :10001446 8B74240C mov esi, [esp + 0C] esi will point to our KEY :1000144A 380E cmp [esi], cl Is the KEY emty ? :1000144C 7419 je 10001467 If yes goto 10001467 and return with code="0" * Referenced by a Jump at Address:10001465(C) | :1000144E C1E206 shl edx, 06 (21) edx="edx*2^6=edx*64d=edx*40h" :10001451 BFE1D61200 mov edi, 0012D6E1 edi="12D6E1" :10001456 0FBE040E movsx byte ptr eax, [esi + ecx] (22) get next number from our KEY :1000145A 03C2 add eax, edx eax="eax+edx" :1000145C 41 inc ecx ecx="ecx+1," counter +1 :1000145D 2BD2 sub edx, edx edx="0" :1000145F F7F7 div edi (23) eax="eax/edi," edx="mod" (eax/edi) :10001461 803C0E00 cmp byte ptr [esi + ecx], 00 Reach end of KEY ? :10001465 75E7 jne 1000144E If not goto 1000144E * Referenced by a Jump at Address:1000144C(C) | :10001467 8BC2 mov eax, edx (24) eax="edx," the code! :10001469 5F pop edi Restore edi :1000146A 5E pop esi Restore esi :1000146B C20400 ret 0004 return To reverse this sub we must start at the end of it at line 10001467 (24)! eax="edx" is the code and it must be E7B37 (15)! (23) Here we see that E7B37 is mod (eax/edi)="mod" (eax/12D6E1) (22) Well, this is shit!, because we will loose information (eax) by each loop. What we know is that eax will be clipped after every 4 number, because... 30*40*40*40+30*40*40+30*40+30="C30C30"> 12D6E1

	Thus we can set a seed KEY &quot;3xx6x1yyyyyyy&quot;, where x can be any number and

	y will be the corrections.First go back to Setup and choice a seed KEY!

			I used for example &quot;3006010000000&quot;.



	To get a valid KEY let us Brute-Force-Crack this babe =)

	Its not the best way, but this code generating part is short, thus

        it will be executed fast.



	Trace to the location at line 100013C1 (15) where the code will be

        compared with E7B37.

	Trace over it to the next line 100013C6 and then we have to code a

        little procedure.

*	EBX is unused, so we will use it as counter. Type in &quot;r ebx=0&quot;.

*	Now type in &quot;a&quot; and let us add a little procedure, which will find

        a valid KEY for us.

	Please adjust the adresses yourself, since this will be typed directly 

        into memory!



*	                &quot;JNZ	GO_ON&quot;		Not a valid KEY, goto GO_ON

*	FOUND&amp;FAIL:	&quot;NOP&quot;			This will be our Stop Point

*	GO_ON:		&quot;CMP	EBX,1312CFF&quot;	Check only numbers from 0-19999999!

*			&quot;JZ	FAIL&quot;		Yes, goto FAIL

*			&quot;MOV	ESI,[ESP+C]&quot;	ESI points to our KEY

*			&quot;MOV	EAX,EBX&quot;	EAX=EBX

*			&quot;MOV	ECX,A&quot;		ECX=A=10d

*	CONVERT_DEC:	&quot;XOR	EDX,EDX&quot;	EDX=0

*			&quot;DIV	ECX&quot;		EAX=EAX/ECX, EDX=MOD (EAX/ECX)

*			&quot;ADD	DL,30&quot;		EDX=EDX+&quot;0&quot;

*			&quot;MOV	[ESI+C],DL&quot;	STORE NUMBER INTO KEY

*			&quot;DEC	ESI&quot;		ESI will point to the previous number

*			&quot;CMP	EAX,0&quot;		Conversion completed ?

*			&quot;JNZ	CONVERT_DEC&quot;	If not goto CONVERT_DEC

*			&quot;JMP	100013B7&quot;	Check this KEY !



The comparision at GO_ON makes sure that the App-ID will not be manipulated !!

*	Ok, you typed in all this mess  ;) Now you must clear all Break-Points &quot;BC *&quot;

*	and then set a Break-Point on execution on line FOUND&amp;FAIL!!

        &quot;BPX <your adress>&quot;.

	Now leave SoftICE and wait.....

	SoftICE will pop up at FOUND&amp;FAIL, so first check EAX, it should be E7B37!

*	If yes, you can get your KEY with &quot;D [ESP+C]&quot;.

	I have found &quot;3006010147046&quot; for my seed KEY ,btw =)



* To get out of this Loop set your EIP to 1000142D &quot;r eip=1000142D&quot; and clear all

  Break-Points!

  Then leave SoftICE, and you will be back in Setup. Cancel it and then start it again

  and use your valid KEY!



Let's summarize:

	- KEY must contain 13 numbers.

	- KEY has got 4 fixed numbers &quot;3xx601yyyyyyy&quot;. 

          Its the App-ID (3601), which may differ in other

	  App from Twelve Tone Systems. Setup handles this App-ID to

          INSHELP before he calls it.

	- yyyyyyy can be found with Brute-Force-Cracking.



This Protection is defeated, lets go over to the...



(SERIAL)		

Well, the KEY was a little bit tricky, heh ? Anyway you are here now to face 

the Serial!

Setup asks for a User-Name, Company and Serial, so lets type in sum crap.

I typed in &quot;NaTzGUL&quot; as User-Name, &quot;REVOLT&quot; as Company and &quot;1234567890&quot; as Serial.

Please proceed with the Serial like in the KEY Section!!

You will land into Setup!, damn the Script is doing the Check, brbrb!



I gave up! There are just too many push,pop and calls, believe me, else try it out!



To defeat this Protection we need a new method!





__________________________



E) SECOND APPROACH



ASSUMPTION:	

I assume that you have read the first Approach and that the App (INSHELP) is 

now once more unpatched in any way !

                

Original state ! You may uncompress the whole App again !



INTRO:	Zen! yeah, thats what we need =)

	

As i told you in our first approach SETUP.INS is the main part of an 

InstallSHIELD Installation!

	

SETUP.INS is a compiled Script, this means before compilation it may have 

the following basic instructions :



			- &quot;IF,THEN,(ELSE)&quot;

			- &quot;GOTO&quot;

			- &quot;CALL&quot;

			- &quot;RETURN()&quot;

			- &quot;LOAD&quot;,&quot;OPEN&quot;,&quot;CLOSE&quot;

			- &quot;MESSAGEBOX&quot;

			-  etc.



			To decrypt the whole mnemonic back to its instructions is not

                        necessary to crack this app,

			so i though that the most important instruction should be

                        the &quot;IF,THEN&quot; one. It should occure very 			

                        often in the Script and it may have the following syntax :



			IF cmp THEN....



			cmp = (arg1) compare_type (arg2)



			arg1 is a variable, arg2 can be a variable or a constant

                        (two constants makes no sense ,of coz !).

			the compare_type can only be one of these six types :



			Type:			Coresponding jmp:

			A compiled COMPARE instruction could look like this :



Compare_mnemonic,result,Byte_A, arg1 , Byte_B, compare_type, Byte_C, arg2



Byte_A is refering arg1, Byte_B gets the compare_type and Byte_C is referring arg2 and

also says if arg2 is a variable or constant.



You maybe have realised , that there are some mnemonic¥s are missing.

As i mentioned this instruction should occure very often in

SETUP.INS, so i examined the file for this byte structure and me found out :



			 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; COMPARE mnemonic (actually 128)!

			 |     |	|

	28,01,32,result_var,Byte_A, arg1 , Byte_B, compare_type, Byte_C, arg2



	Byte_A=&quot;B&quot;=0x42	means variable_index(word) is following

	Byte_B=&quot;A&quot;=0x41	means constant (dword) is following



	Byte_C=&quot;A&quot;=0x41	if comparing with a constant

	Byte_C=&quot;B&quot;=0x42	if comparing two viriables



	result_var	= type of word (variable_index)

	arg1		= type of word (variable_index)

	compare_type	= type of dword (1-6)

	arg2		= type of word (variable_index) or dword (constant)



	Example : lets say we have found the following bytes .



	28,01,32, 03,00, 42, 01,00, 41, compare_type, 42, 02,00



	This will compare a variable with index 0x0001 and a varible with index 0x002

	with the specific compare_type and then stores the result (0/1) 

        of this comparision into the variable with index 0x003.



	Now what we need are the type of comparisions, hmm... how should we obtain them?

	Setup is executing this Script, so there is the place we have to

        search for them!

			

        I W32dasm Setup.exe and searched for the place where compare_type

        gets compared with 1-6 and i found them at line 0043C89B.

			Ok, let us summerize the compare_types :



			Type:			math.exp.:	Coresponding jmp:		Compare Type (dword):



			LOWER-EQUAL	<= JLE 1 GREATER-EQUAL>=			JGE				2

			LOWER		<jl 3 GREATER>			JG				4

			NOT-EQUAL		!=			JNE				5

			EQUAL		=			JE				6



			MESSAGEBOX byte structure :



2A,0,61,length(word),text will show a messagebox with the specific text!





Since the compare part of an IF-THEN instruction is what we really need for our interest

you could now go directly to the START further below!



Otherwise learn more about other instructions and how they are build up =)



The structure of a compiled IF-THEN instruction may look like this :



	COMPARE , BRANCH_TO location IF !(result - arg_x)



	(result - arg_x) will be zero if they are equal else it will be not zero.

The result comes from the comparision and arg_x can be a varible or a constant.



	Now we come to the IF-THEN byte structure :



	COMPARE-structure,BRANCH_TO_mnemonic,l_index, SUB, Byte_A,result,Byte_C,arg_x



	BRANCH_TO_mnemonic	= 22,0,70

	SUB				= 95 (in an IF-THEN instruction!)



	Byte_A=&quot;B&quot;=0x42	result of comparision will allways be a variable_index

	Byte_C=&quot;A&quot;=0x41	arg_x allways will be a constant in an IF-THEN instruction!



	l_index	= type of word (index)

	result		= type of word (variable_index)

	arg_x		= will be a dword (constant) =0x00000000 in an IF-THEN instruction!



	The branch location will be an offset into the script and it is calculated like this :



	location = dword [ l_index* 6 + Branch-Table-Offset+2]

	Location-Table-Offset = Offset &quot;_EWQ&quot;			;in this script it was 14546!



	Just search for &quot;_EWQ&quot; and you will find it (Its linked at the end of the script)!



	GOTO byte stucture :



	2C,00,70,l_index



	There are more instructions i have decrypted, but we dont need them

        for this tutorial.

	Its quite easy to write a Decompiler with this information and if

        you have found out the location where Setup is executing the script 

        then its not that hard to see what it is doing depending on the mnemonic, 

        But thats another story and this tutorial is getting damn big enough!



	Now we can try out our first Script-Cracking attempt =)...



START:



(CD-CHECK)		

First think about how this check was written with the Script instructions !!

	The easiest way may be done like this :

	(Assume: Return_of_INSHELP=0/1 (BAD/GOOD)! )



	arg1=CALL(INSHELP,CD-CHECK)

	IF arg1 = 0 THEN MESSAGEBOX &quot;Setup must be run from the original CD&quot;:END

		ELSE RETURN(1)



		or this...



		arg1=CALL(INSHELP,CD-CHECK)

		IF arg1 != 0 THEN RETURN(1)

			ELSE MESSAGEBOX &quot;Setup must be run from the original CD&quot;:RETURN(0)



After compiling this pice of code, the bytes would look like this :



28,01,32,&quot;B&quot;,arg1 (word),&quot;A&quot;,6 (dword),&quot;A&quot;,0 (dword),...,2A,0,61,27 (word),&quot;Setup must be...&quot;



		or this...



28,01,32,&quot;B&quot;,arg1 (word),&quot;A&quot;,5 (dword),&quot;A&quot;,0 (dword),...,2A,0,61,27 (word),&quot;Setup must be...&quot;





	I have retrieved this part of SETUP.INS for you....(Offset 8D70)



	arg1_Variable_index (word) <<> compare_type_5!

	result_Variable_index (word)  <<< | | | IF mnemonic <<<<< | | | | | * | | | | | | | | 00008D70 9A FF 42 2D 00 28 01 32 2D 00 42 9B FF 41 05 00 ..B-.(.2-.B..A.. 00008D80 00 00 41 00 00 00 00 22 00 70 53 01 95 42 2D 00 ..A....".pS..B-. 00008D90 41 00 00 00 00 2A 00 61 27 00 53 65 74 75 70 20 A....*.a'.Setup 00008DA0 6D 75 73 74 20 62 65 20 72 75 6E 20 66 72 6F 6D must berun from 00008DB0 20 74 68 65 20 6F 72 69 67 69 6E 61 6C 20 43 44 theoriginal CD We see that its compare_type_5 (!=")," so we just have to change it into 6 (=")" at Offset 8D7E to defeat this CD-CHECK, isnt it easy !

Change Offset(904C) to 6 and this KEY-Protection will be history,hehe! You can now type in anything you want and it will be valid. BTW, if you also change Offset(8FDC) to 4 it will also accept an empty KEY! (Serial) Ok, now we will see if this Script-Cracking will defeat this damn Serial-Check ! This Check dont use INSHELP or any other DLL. It strickly uses the Script !! This means we cant espect a simple compare_type_5 or 6 before its messagebox ! There is no other way than using our beloved SoftICE a bit ! To see what Setup is comparing when he checks the Serial we must first type in User-Name,(Company) and a Serial. I used "123456789" as Serial. Now invoke SoftICE with its hotkey (Strg+D) and make sure you are inside Setup¥s Adress-Context ("Setup" in the right, bottom egde) , otherwise leave SoftICE and invoke it again until you are there. If you are inside the Kernel or inside User API just * trace back with "F12" until you are in Setup! * Set BPX on 0043C89B "bpx 0043C89B" the entry point of the compare part! Now leave SoftICE and press NEXT-> .

	SoftICE will pop up at 0043C89B several times and Setup will

        perform comparisions !

			

Here is my history of the comparisions :



Comparisions:		Compare_type:



(1)	0	!=	1	5		Not important

(2)	0	&gt;=	3	2		Not important (chr-position counter?)



(3)	9	<= 0 1 This looks like our Serial-length! (4) 61>	31	4		Well, its the first char of our Serial!

(5)	7A	<31 3 and it setup is checking if it is (6) 41>	31	4		between &quot;a&quot;-&quot;z&quot;,&quot;A&quot;-&quot;Z&quot;,&quot;0&quot;-&quot;9&quot;

(7)	5A	<31 3 (8) 30>	31	4

(9)	39	<31 3 (10) 3 <="0" 1 Not important(chr-position counter?) BREAK. It seems that it checks every char from our serial seperately. Since our Serial is not valid lets fake this check! (3) This really looks like a char position pointer, which is compared to our serial length. We have to reverse this compare to get out of this check!

If you have change the byte at (3) offset (63BE) to 2 you will get to the final check. (11) Setup will finally check if 13 chars of your serial were valid! Just change byte at (11) offset (653D) to 5 and this Serial check will be defeated! Summarize: You see now that Script Cracking is much easier than the first approach! We only have to search for MessageBoxes and analyze the script. At all we only have to edit (patch) the script and thats all=")" If i find out more instructions then you even will be able to get a valid Serial(Keymaker)! A Decompiler will follow anyway. Its only a question of time when it will be written so watch out for it,hehe. __________________________ F) ADD-0ON This part will describe the most common InstallSHIELD Installation. If Setup.exe (InstallSHIELD 2.x) is a 16 Bit executeable, then its called The Installation launcher. It needs a support file called _inst32i.ex_ to install under a win32 OS. This Installation is a bit different from the one i have cracked in this Tutorial. _inst32i.ex_ is compressed but not with icompx, but it dont matter! and it contains the following files : INSTALL.EXE _INS0432._MP LZWSERV.EXE _INZ0432._MP WUTL95i.DLL _WUTL95.DLL BOOT16.EXE _INJ0432._MP You can retrieve these File-Names at the beginning of _inst32i.ex_ by yourself. Setup will do the initialization and then it uncompresses _inst32i.ex_ into your Windows-Temp (C:\Windows\Temp). When ya start the Installation you will see the following in Windows\Temp: <_ISTMP0.DIR>		DIR		This dir will be created by _ins0432._mp!

		_INS0432._MP		659 KB	This is exactly Setup.exe from this Tutorial !

		_INZ0432._MP		20,1 KB	This is LZWSERV.EXE (doing the de-compress.)

		_WUTIL95.DLL		36,0 KB	A win95 support file



	_ISTMP0.DIR content :			

		_SETUP.LIB		151 KB	This is exactly the same compressed lib file!

		1f8584.DLL		89,0 KB	Support DLL

		_INSHELP.DLL		23,5 KB	Yup, da same DLL!

		_UNINST.EXE		292 KB	Also da same one



You see now that there are the same files, but only renamed , thats all!

Copy and rename them if you wanna work with these files.



__________________________



G) WIN32.HLP



	These Descriptions comes from win32.hlp



		GetDriveType:



	The GetDriveType function determines whether a disk drive is a removable,

	fixed, CD-ROM, RAM disk, or network drive.



			UINT GetDriveType(



			    LPCTSTR  lpRootPathName 	// address of root path

			   );

			Parameters



			lpRootPathName



Points to a null-terminated string that specifies the root directory of

the disk to return information about. If lpRootPathName is NULL, the

function uses the root of the current directory.



Return Value



The return value specifies the type of drive. It can be one of the following values:



			Value	Meaning

			0	The drive type cannot be determined.

			1	The root directory does not exist.

			2	The drive can be removed from the drive.

			3	The disk cannot be removed from the drive.

			4	The drive is a remote (network) drive.

			5	The drive is a CD-ROM drive.

			6	The drive is a RAM disk.

			



________



			GetVolumeInformation:



The GetVolumeInformation function returns information about a file

system and volume whose root directory is specified.



			BOOL GetVolumeInformation(



    LPCTSTR  lpRootPathName,	// address of root directory of the file system

    LPTSTR  lpVolumeNameBuffer,	// address of name of the volume

    DWORD  nVolumeNameSize,	// length of lpVolumeNameBuffer

    LPDWORD  lpVolumeSerialNumber,	// address of volume serial number

    LPDWORD  lpMaximumComponentLength,	// address of system's maximum filename 										   length

    LPDWORD  lpFileSystemFlags,	// address of file system flags

    LPTSTR  lpFileSystemNameBuffer,	// address of name of file system

    DWORD  nFileSystemNameSize 	// length of lpFileSystemNameBuffer

			   );

Parameters



	lpRootPathName



Points to a string that contains the root directory of the volume to be described. 

If this parameter is NULL, the root of the current directory is used.



	lpVolumeNameBuffer



Points to a buffer that receives the name of the specified volume.



	nVolumeNameSize



Specifies the length, in characters, of the volume name buffer.

This parameter is ignored if the volume name buffer is not supplied.



	lpVolumeSerialNumber



Points to a variable that receives the volume serial number. This

parameter can be NULL if the serial number is not required.



	lpMaximumComponentLength



Points to a doubleword value that receives the maximum length, in

characters, of a filename component supported by the specified file

system. A filename component is that portion of a filename between 			

backslashes.

		

The value stored in variable pointed to by *lpMaximumComponentLength is 

used to indicate that long names are supported by the specified file system. 

For example, for a FAT file system supporting long names, the function 

stores the value 255, rather than the previous 8.3 indicator. 

Long names can also be supported on systems that use the NTFS and HPFS 

file systems.



	lpFileSystemFlags



Points to a doubleword that receives flags associated with the

specified file system. This parameter can be any combination of the

following flags, with one exception: FS_FILE_COMPRESSION and 			

FS_VOL_IS_COMPRESSED are mutually exclusive.



	Value	Meaning

FS_CASE_IS_PRESERVED	If this flag is set, the file system preserves

the case of filenames when it 			places a name on disk.

FS_CASE_SENSITIVE	If this flag is set, the file system supports

case-sensitive filenames.

FS_UNICODE_STORED_ON_DISK	If this flag is set, the file system

supports Unicode in 			filenames as they appear on disk.

FS_PERSISTENT_ACLS	If this flag is set, the file system preserves

and enforces ACLs. For 			example, NTFS preserves and enforces ACLs,

HPFS and FAT do not.

FS_FILE_COMPRESSION	The file system supports file-based

compression.

FS_VOL_IS_COMPRESSED	The specified volume is a compressed volume;

for example, a 			DoubleSpace volume.



			lpFileSystemNameBuffer



			Points to a buffer that receives the name of the file system (such

as FAT, HPFS, or NTFS).



			nFileSystemNameSize



			Specifies the length, in characters, of the file system name

buffer. This parameter is ignored if the file 			system name buffer is

not supplied.



			Return Value



			If all the requested information is retrieved, the return value is

TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE. To get 			extended error information,

call GetLastError.



			Remarks



			The FS_VOL_IS_COMPRESSED flag is the only indicator of volume-based

compression. The file 			system name is not altered to indicate

compression. This flag comes back set on a DoubleSpace 			volume, for

example. With volume-based compression, an entire volume is either

compressed or not 			compressed.

			The FS_FILE_COMPRESSION flag indicates whether a file system

supports file-based compression. 			With file-based compression,

individual files can be compressed or not compressed.

			The FS_FILE_COMPRESSION and FS_VOL_IS_COMPRESSED flags are mutually

exclusive; 			both bits cannot come back set.



			The maximum component length value, stored in the DWORD variable

pointed to by 			lpMaximumComponentLength, is the only indicator that

a volume supports longer-than-normal FAT (or 			other file system)

file names. The file system name is not altered to indicate support

for long file names.

			The GetCompressedFileSize function obtains the compressed size of a

file. The GetFileAttributes 			function can determine whether an

individual file is compressed.

			



________



			GetWindowText:



			The GetWindowText function copies the text of the specified

window's title bar (if it has one) into a 			buffer. If the specified

window is a control, the text of the control is copied.



			int GetWindowText(



			    HWND  hWnd,	// handle of window or control with text

			    LPTSTR  lpString,	// address of buffer for text

			    int  nMaxCount 	// maximum number of characters to copy

			   );

			Parameters



			hWnd



			Identifies the window or control containing the text.



			lpString



			Points to the buffer that will receive the text.



			nMaxCount



			Specifies the maximum number of characters to copy to the buffer.

If the text exceeds this limit, it is 			truncated.



			Return Value



			If the function succeeds, the return value is the length, in

characters, of the copied string, not 			including the terminating

null character. If the window has no title bar or text, if the title

bar is empty, or if 			the window or control handle is invalid, the

return value is zero. To get extended error information, call 			

GetLastError.

			This function cannot retrieve the text of an edit control in

another application.



			Remarks

This function causes a WM_GETTEXT message to be sent to the specified window or control.

This function cannot retrieve the text of an edit control in another application.
