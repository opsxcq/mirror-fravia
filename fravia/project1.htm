Hexeditors reverse engineering<BR>(and other tools of the trade)<BR>



</FONT><BR><B>Binary editors</B><BR> Binary editors are usually refered to as a hexeditors. The main

difference between a regular texteditor and a hexeditor is that a texteditor

translates some bytes to tabs, linefeeds, carriage returns, etc or simply

ignores them. A hexeditor does no such thing, instead it prints the

hexadecimal value of the byte. Most hexeditors have a textfield as well, where

you'll see all sorts of funny-looking faces and arrows. <BR>

<BR>

<BR>We have decided to include in this project also all other essays related to important 

&quot;tools of the trade&quot;, like IDA: Interactive disassembler, the most powerful 

disassembler around now (with its version 3.7).<BR> 

IDA is an 'official +HCU tool' 1997!   <BR>

<I>

A very important project... hexeditors are the swiss knifes that we continuously 

use... +ORC seems to prefer good old <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/psedit.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/psedit.zip'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/psedit.zip">psedit</A>, and even 

if we still use it a lot, we use more and more hexworkshop, 

(cannot be wrong: version 2.1 has been cracked by +ORC himself in his lesson <A href="howto93.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howto93.htm">9.3</A>... 

as he explained the &quot;dead listing&quot; approach).<BR><BR>

The +HCU has received various essays about hexeditors reverse engineering, and about other 

important tools for our trade... here are 

the best ones, stay tuned for more!

beautiful essay by Quine, which shines methodologically and has a relevance that encompasses 

almost all fields of our trade. There are things inside here, like patching pointers and 

Boundchecker API-intercepting,   

wich clearly are NOT FOR NEWBYES, and the whole essay is GOLD worth 

for all serious reverse engineers. This essay has been added to the +HCU didactic material 

(pending Quine's authorization) and will from now on be distributed to all

<I>Well, back to DOS! Was about time! Contrarly to what some 

still choose to  

believe, dos reversing is far from being an obsolete activity: many very important 

programs are working under DOS, because Windoze simply does not give enough 

power, and as +ORC told us long ago in his tut, many of the older DOS protections 

are much more tougher and interesting than the banal <FONT color="red">cmp eax, 1</FONT> tricks inside 

&quot;compiled&quot; windoze targets...<BR>

There is another very nice lesson teached here by Frog's Pint: let's not 

be lazy! Almost anyone uses a &quot;ready cracked&quot; (read &quot;stolen&quot;) Sourcer 7 version which comes with 

a pirated serial number inside it: the 

whole Web is polluted with all pirated versions of this important tool, and 

noone seems to care about the only  thing that is really 

fascinating in our opinion: how to reverse this reverser program 

'par excellence'. And Frog's Print does exactly this, and he writes:

<FONT color="blue"><BR>As we are crackers, <U>let's throw away</U> this serial number and

crack Sourcer 7.0</FONT><BR>Right! And if you add to 

these 'strategic' thoughts the whole cursor bpinting, you'll agree with me that this 

essay deserves to be posistioned among the prestigious 

&quot;Advanced cracking series&quot;. Enjoy!

<I>Well, this is SERIOUS ADVANCED CRACKING once more. Once more a fundamental tool of the 

trade (IDA). Once more a function reenabling work (the loading of the previous databases, i.e. 

one of the most important crippled functions of the crippled version: you do not want to 

start everything anew every time you use IDA, do you?). Once more something 

we all need: new knowledge that you can at once apply to other targets and reverse 

engineering endeavours.<BR>

Quine is getting us used to 

this kind of well-crafted essays. I'm afraid newbyes will not understand much here, 

please read the 'basic' essays first, and peruse the <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://207.30.50.126/gthorne/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://207.30.50.126/gthorne/'" tppabs="http://207.30.50.126/gthorne/">other</A>

from Aesculapius how this protection scheme works. It's interesting and the keygenerator in asm at the 

bottom can easily be modified for other targets. If you crack Ultraedit register it

<BR><BR>

<I>Well, an interesting little essay which deals with an utility by Eugene 

Roshal that is in my opinion injustely underestimated. Winrar should by all 

means be on your desktop: it has, on mine, taken the place of my 

Winzip 6.2 (it deals without problems with all zipped files as well), 

and that for many reasons, the more important one is that RARed archives are 

SMALLER than pkzipped archives!<BR>No, I'm not speaking of the solid archive 

option (you don't know what 'solid' archiving is? Go and study winrar), I'm 

speaking of a normal, default rar archive: it's smaller than a zip!<BR>I know that many don't even know it, and I 

myself am still compelled to use the zip format when I dump something on 

the web 'because everybody zips'. Yet I myself, for myself, on my own harddisks, 

use only RAR, because with the monstruous overbloated programs we are 

dealing with 'every spared byte counts'... and you'll spare a lot of bytes 

in comparison with zipped files if you rar. You still don't believe me? Well, 

read, enjoy and then go and download winrar... you'll be surprised seeing 

how GOOD this tool is.!

Some explanations on IDA, by Quine, 6 November 1997<BR></CENTER></FONT>

</CENTER>

<PRE>

  Dear fravia+,



	I'm very pleased to see people using IDA.  I really, you know,

think of it as a dear friend now (I know this sounds sick :-).  Just

thought I'd clear up a few points from Snatch's and zeezee's essays.



From <A href="qvsnatc.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/qvsnatc.htm">Snatch</A>'s essay:



	The 'aThelab' that Snatch finds is the name of a location in the

data section, a location that contains the ASCII string &quot;The lab....&quot;.

Just double click on 'aThelab' and you'll jump right there.  I was a

little confused by your reference to Smartcheck regarding this.

Anyway, IDA names every location that it can in the data section (and

everywhere else for that matter) and it uses the 'a'+beginning of

string for ASCII strings.  Admittedly, it does not have that nice

dialog box that w32dasm has that lists all the strings (or are they

ALL the strings in w32dasm?  No! Just the ones directly referenced in

the code), but zeezee's Alt-B searches work just fine.



From <A href="zeeida1.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/zeeida1.htm">zeezee</A>'s essay:



	Zeezee has obviously spent some time with IDA and all of his tips

are quite sound.  Just as a matter of style, I prefer to keep the

crossrefernces at about 10 -- you can always use

View--&gt;Crossreferences to see the rest.  This keeps screen clutter

down.  IDA's 'automagically' finding the names is of course its

library recognition function (one of its MOST powerful features).

Keep in mind that there may be more names to be found than what it

automatically does.  Often, at the beginning of the status window it

recommends optional libraries to check for.  Most commonly if yuo have

a M$ compiled file, it is poosible that it uses MFC linked statically

(ie, not in a dll).  IDA cannot always be sure of this, so try

applying the MFC library recognition (View--&gt;Signatures).  You'll be

amazed at the wealth of information.

	Regarding IDA's weaknesses, yes the help is a little cumbersome,

but as zeezee says, it is all there.  The resource problem is a

problem, but only temporarily.  Look at the file resource.idc in the

idc directory (in fact, look at and study everything in that

directory).  It is a file for sorting out resources in NE files (a

remnant of the horrible days of Win16-- among other things the ugliest

OS ever).  What needs to be done is someone needs to write a really

idc script/macro/program to sort out PE resources.  I have plans to do

this, but who knows when that will happen.  In general, people need to

study the idc language.  Its power is amazing given that it's solely

done for IDA.



	Oh, one last thing.  Go through the ida.cfg file and above all

else, change the window size.  Until I figured out how to do this, I

found IDA impossible to use.  Make it big.  I have mine set at 132x64.

Anyway, you need a big space to work in.



Hope this helps.
