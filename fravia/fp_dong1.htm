Oh my... the dongle old aera is finished. Out.<BR>

That's it, nothing more to add...  let's hope we get a new dongle aera to work on.<BR>

Awesome essay. Frog's Print's incredible work should be printed (44 pages !) 

and sipped slowly, it's 

'cracking for conoisseurs'... fravia's vintage 1998 "grand reserve"!<BR>Bye bye to all 

those that wanted to do some quick bucks selling hardware protections that 

were NOT protections at all. This is good, nobody will mourn the disappearing of 

smoke-sellers and bogus protectors.  Bye bye to all those that never 

cared to study assembly. This is good.  

Bye bye to all the creations of the poor programmers that 

blindly trusted commercial (and THEREFORE bogus) dongle 

protections to defend their valuable software instead of writing 

their own much more solide protections. Tsch Tsch.<BR>

You had better read +ORC's students essays first... next time. 

And learn. And now don't come to the silly idea to blame Frog's Print...  

blame those dilettantes that have sold you smoke. Blame yourself. A little 

<A href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm">reality cracking</A> would have done you 

some good, probably. Well, one never ends learning, does one? I would 

never have believed myself that (almost) all implementations of the 

dongle protections scheme were so 

stupid. Oh my, how low, how deep have the programmers fallen, since Micro$oft introduced its 

frilly-dizzy rattamazz operating system :-)<BR>Of course anyone of my readers 

could now just 'go shopping' and download, fetch or get hundred thousand 

dongle protected software programs, each one of them -incidentally- 

extremely expensive. DO NOT DO IT. You'll only stuff your already exploding harddisks to 

death for <U>nothing</U> and bore yourself to death.<BR> See, you don't 

need to do it: that poor   

software won't disappear, nor it will go away. It will always be there. It wont 

be dongle protected any more after this, oh no, no, no :-)<BR> Yet, probably 

it will be as poorly 

protected as before by some other charlatans, smoke-selling some other 'infallible' protection 

scheme... people never learn. Unless they study. That's why you are here, my good reader, 

to master a difficult but POWERFUL art: reversing.<BR>

So don't steal the software that Frog's Print has now stripped naked. Look at those 

protection schemes, pathetically whining and sobbing under Frog's streng and mighty 

reversing blick. They wont be ever able to run away, the poor scared things.<BR> 

Of course -as it happens- this essay could be useful AGAINST THEFT.. for our 

underfunded public universities for instance, where 

(as I very well know) hardware dongles are regularly and phisycally stolen from their 

parallel ports (it's difficult to find a way to fest them there and students don't 

show any respect for public property any more, having being corrupted by the 'sacrality' of 

private gains and property)... so this 

essay may be a good reading, for all colleagues in the public sector, in order to protect 

against stupid vandalic theft their legally bought software 

as well :-)<BR>See: +crackers bring solutions for the good ones and ruin for the evil ones :-)

<TT>Due to the huge Dongle/Security advertisement

campaign overrunning the Net those days (may be the biggest ever), mostly

from Aladdin (Hasp) and Rainbow Technologies (Sentinel), I decided to start

a first approach on this kind of protection.</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>For this, I needed Dongle programs.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>-Q: Where the hell could we find Dongle protected softs??&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>-A: On the Net!</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>Yes, on the Net and for FREE. It's just like sharewares: you download

them, sometimes as the fully working update/new version or as a demo you

can test, and, if you send money to the author, you get a dongle instead

of a password.</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>I fetched 14 of them, all different kind :</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>From Hasp, Sentinel, DesKEY, Activator/Unikey to 'home-made' dongles,

simple or not, cheap or very expensive softs, small or overbloated, useless

or useful, running under Windows 32bit, 16bit or DOS, cracked them using

Live approach, Dead Listing or Zen cracking : every one to his taste!&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>After that, I can already give you my conclusion:&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>What a disappointment! Only one soft out of 14 had an interesting

protection (<A HREF="#Micro Cap">MicroCap V</A>). So, dongles appear to

be a good "ready_to_use" protection but <B><U>they are NOT</U></B>. They

are as much complicated to program as they are to crack (sometimes even

more). If you are a programmer and want to use a dongle to protect your

soft, you must understand that you need to have real strong knowledge about

protection and programming. Otherwise just forget it (and you'll save money).&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P><!-- PASTE HERE YOUR INTRODUCTION --><TT>So, Dongles could be a very

powerful and strong way to protect a soft...as long as the programmer willing

to utilize one knows how to use it. Unfortunately, most of them don't (note

that we are not talking about shareware programmers but professional guys!

) and are still using our "beloved" <I>Test eax,eax//jnz Bad_Guy</I> stupid

routine, thinking that they don't have to worry about the protection because

the dongle will take care of it (same old problem discussed so much often

here -: ). Some of them use ridiculous $5 shareware tricks to protect $4.000

professional softs (see <A HREF="#Vision">Vision XXL</A>) and, worse, others

just forgot to read the Dongle documentation manual shipped with their

hardware key (see <A HREF="#ABBCS31">ABBCS31</A>), you'll even find some

of the most amazingly stupid protections I can't find any words to describe

them (see <A HREF="#read_and_forget">DigiSHOW</A>). Too bad...specially

when those programs are available for free download on the Net.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;



<P><TT>Sometimes it may be useful to know which dongle is needed for the

program you want to crack (Aladdin's Hasp, Rainbow Technologies' Sentinel,

Dinkey, Everlock...) or, <B>very important</B> if you plan to use SoftICE

and some Breakpoints, the type of dongle (parallel or serial key, internal

or PCMCIA card, Network dongle...), sometimes you won't even have to care

about that. And, finally, in just few cases, you may not be able to crack

a program if you don't have the right dongle (but if you have the dongle

why should you crack it? -: ) or because the program is strongly encrypted

and/or uses too many anti-debugger and anti-w32dasm/IDAPro protections

(usually, those anti-crackers protections are not written by the programer

himself :- ).&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>For this, never forget to read carefully the program's doc or HLP

files, to visit it's company home page (specially the "installation help"

or "FAQ" pages) to collect the maximum infos about the dongle needed. You'll

find them most of the time, but sometimes you may only find that the program

needs a "green" or "red" dongle. So don't forget to monitor the program

installation on your Hard Drive : for all the programs of this essay, during

their installation I used CleanSweep, WinDelete and TechFacts, all 3 programs

running at the same time. Then check for new .Vxd, .Drv, .Sys and .Dll

files in you windows(/system) or the programs directories. Do the same

the first time you'll run the program because it may use/create and hide

a lot of "~x34_m-!.sys" or similar strange named files anywhere on your

HD. If you can identify the Dongle manufacturer, then visit its WWW/FTP

sites, newsgroups, read newspaper articles about it and visit programmers'

tools retailers companies sites like <A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.sosdevelopers.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.sosdevelopers.com/'" tppabs="http://www.sosdevelopers.com/">SOSdevelopers</A>

(if you can understand French), download their softs/demos (SOSdevelopers

<A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.sosdevelopers.com/scripts/ListeDemo.asp  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.sosdevelopers.com/scripts/ListeDemo.asp'" tppabs="http://www.sosdevelopers.com/scripts/ListeDemo.asp">download section</A>),

get their free catalogue where you'll find all products for programers

and the latest protections tools of the market (BTW, SOSdevelopers is probably

actually one of the rare place where you can still find SoftICE 3.01 and

all others Numega 14 days trial version products available for downloading

since Numaga lately removed their Download section from their WWW home

site -: ). And finally, if you plan to crack several dongle protected softs,

install and monitor the first one, crack it and then <B>delete</B> it before

installing the second one, third one... otherwise it'll be to messy and

complicated to monitor and crack.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P><TT>Here is now, for instance, some infos I found at <A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.aks.com/hasp/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.aks.com/hasp/'" tppabs="http://www.aks.com/hasp/">Aladdin

to write a "good" protection for their dongle (blue comments are mine of

course!):</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT><FONT SIZE=+0>Tips and Tricks for Maximum Protection (from Aladdin

SoftWares)</FONT>&nbsp;</TT></I>&nbsp;



<P><I><TT>The golden rule of HASP-based software protection is that the

protection system is only as secure as the routines that call the key and

decide whether to allow execution of the protected program. In other words,&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>since the hardware of HASP keys is too complicated to break

or duplicate, <U>hackers will usually try to trace the protection code

and eliminate the protection routines</U>.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">Emulating the Dongle by re-writing its main

routine is much funnier than boring tracing and patching (and sometimes

a lot easier, specially the Hasp protection routine! )</FONT></TT><I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>While we supply you with the best hardware and software protection

tools available, and while the HASP Envelope can by itself provide an excellent

protection for application programs, if possible, <U>you should enhance

your protection system by implementing the Application Programming Interface

(API) as well</U>.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">If only they knew how to do it...</FONT></TT><I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;



<P><I><TT>Please keep in mind that while no single technique can defeat

every hacker, the more traps and safeguards you use, the more difficult

it will be to break your software. In order to achieve maximum protection

with HASP, we suggest you implement at least some of the procedures outlined

below:&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT><B>Issue as many calls as possible with many different Seed

Codes.</B>&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>The more calls and expected responses you use, <U>the more difficult

it will be to trace and remove them</U>.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">Boring yes, difficult not really.</FONT></TT><I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;



<P><I><TT><B>Perform logical divisions of the checking procedure.</B> Divide

the checking procedure, and if possible, spread it across your program

at far-away points.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>A logical division would be: calling, checking, and reacting

routines, each <U>situated in a different section of the program</U>.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT><B>Hide parts of the checking code within a regular source code.</B>

For example, the calling routine can be <U>hidden within a general initialization

routine</U>.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">Easy to find with a BPIO 278/378</FONT></TT><I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;



<P><I><TT><B>Use complicated mathematical expressions.</B> In order to

confuse hackers, check for the Return Codes <U>using complicated mathematical

expressions</U>. For example, if you are expecting a Return Code which

equals 26387, incorporate an expression such as the one below to perform

the check:&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If (ReturnCode1 -

7)/4 = (ExpectedReturnCode1 - 6602)/3&nbsp; then...</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>To further enhance your level of security, follow the same procedure

throughout your software for any mathematical constants used in implementing

your HASP software protection solution.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">Yes, and add a beautiful jnz_Bad_Guy at the

end...</FONT><I>&nbsp;</I></TT><I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;



<P><I><TT><B>Use delayed reactions.</B> Do not react immediately to a checking

call. For example,do not test for a certain value and then issue an error

message if you do not like the result. If you do, the hacker will easily

understand what you are doing.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>It is better to store the value in a variable A, check A's value

a few subroutine calls later, and set a new variable B to say whether or

not you like it. Several calls after that, test the value of B, and only

then issue the error message.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>Force hackers to work backward to figure out how B got a certain

value and why the program fails because of that. The relation to the original

returned value should no longer be obvious.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">See above</FONT></TT><I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;



<P><I><TT><B>Perform check-sums.</B> Perform a check-sum on the program

to find out if it has been&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>tampered with. The most effective means to do this is with the

HASP Pro Kit.&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>Otherwise, the simplest way to do so is to use the following

pattern:&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calculate check-sum.</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compare with correct

value.</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the two do not

match,</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

issue an error message;</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

otherwise, continue.</TT>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;

<BR><I><TT>Unfortunately, this technique is vulnerable to several attacks.</TT></I>&nbsp;

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">Bad luck!</FONT><I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>etc,etc...&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR>

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">

<BR><TT>To crack a dongle, you must first locate the protection you'll

have to crack. Any means are good:</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>-searching in the program or its DLLs the main dongle routine (I

wrote my own <I>haspfind.com</I>&nbsp; that search a directory for the

file where the Hasp routine is located).</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>-Bpio with softICE. It will always work (as long as you don't forget

to install the driver and, most of the time, reboot to load it) but you

may easily get stuck/lost deep inside complex routines.</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>-Since most programs will issue an error message ("Dongle not found"...)

you may just have to BPX the MessageBoxA functions or all other similar

ones and find the cross-references.</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>-Disassembling the file to find some "Check_If_Dongle_OK" exported

functions.</TT>&nbsp;



<P><TT>After that, there are different ways to crack it:&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>1/Reverse engineering the dongle protection main routine in order

to emulate the dongle (see <A HREF="#ABBCS31">ABBCS31</A>).&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>-This is very efficient specially if this routine is called dozens

or sometimes hundreds of times throughout the program (otherwise we would

have to patch all those cross-references!).&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>-With this method, you don't need to have the dongle driver loaded

(if you have 10 programs using different dongles, you'll need to have 10

different drivers always loaded).&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>2/Patching some <I>Call</I>, <I>Test</I> or <I>jnz</I> instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>Not the most elegant method but useful if:&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>-you don't know how the dongle protection routine works but you

quickly found the right <I>Bad_Guy </I>Flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>-your program is to slow to start/run . Some overbloated EXE or

DLL will check for a dongle, dongle ID and Seed Code and, if they can't

find them, will check again and again before telling you that you don't

have the requested hardware key. For that reason, those programs may check

for the dongle for 15 or sometimes +30 seconds. This even happens sometimes

after you "emulated" the Dongle. A real waste of time! (see <A HREF="#WellCAD">WellCAD</A>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>3/Brute force approach:&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>Close to the above solution, this one may be quite useful for program

that may react strangely when they are modified. This method just force

them to work the way you want (see <A HREF="#Ai Damage">Ai Damage</A>).</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>4/You may use your own tips/findings like searching with Hiew the

bytes sequence 0xE900000000</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>jmp Next_Instruction (see <A HREF="#OmniMark">OmniMark</A>).</TT>&nbsp;



<P><TT>In this essay, we'll just assume that you are familiar with cracking

because I won't give a lot of comments about all usual protections routines/tricks...

that don't have anything to see with the dongle protection nor will I spend

time to explain how to crack it when it will be quite obvious (most of

the time).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;



<P><TT>As said above, all programs cracked in this essay can be found and

download on their companies homepages (see links below).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>&nbsp;

<BR><TT>You'll find plenty of dongle softs to download for free on the

Net. Just learn how to search and you'll see what I mean.</TT>&nbsp;

V v2.10</FONT></U></B>

<BR><B>-Description:</B>

<BR>Integrated schematic editor and mixed analog/digital simulator that

provides an interactive sketch and simulate environment for electronics

engineers.

<BR><B>-OS:</B>

<BR>Win95 / NT(?)

<BR><B>-Protection:</B>

<BR>Dongle (parallel). Driver: <I>Hasp95.vxd</I> (c:\windows\system).

<BR><B>-Misc.:</B>

<BR>Does NOT run if no dongle detected.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P><TT>Apparently, Micro-Cap V programmers are the only guys who understood

that the dongle will not do all the job. They tried to add some improvements

to the protection scheme:</TT>

<BR><TT>-Fake flags (Bad or Good_Guy).</TT>

<BR><TT>-Several flags hidden at different locations (using different registers).</TT>

<BR><TT>-Delayed reactions (calling, checking and reacting routines).</TT>

<BR><TT>-Mathematical expressions for checking the RetCodes (though they

could improve this part).</TT>

<BR><TT>-Several calls with different Seed Codes.</TT>

<BR><TT>...</TT>



<P><TT>This is the first Hasp dongle of this essay. I hope you read Zafer's

essay about the various hasp-dongle services because I will not explain

this again. However, I will show you the main Hasp routine from Micro-Cap

as it is just a little different from the one describe by Zafer, but it

works just the same:</TT>

<BR><TT>RetCodes 2, 3 and 4 are displayed in the code (0xF66D, 0xD66C,

0x3B97). To check the RetCode1, the program uses simple mathematical expressions

from offset 422B63 to offset 422B75.</TT>

<BR><TT>Finding the RetCode1 value is simple.</TT>

<BR><TT>We have:</TT>

<BR><TT>0x2D98 = (RetCode1 - 0x19CA) / 5</TT>

<BR><TT>So:</TT>

<BR><TT>RetCode1 = (0x2D98 * 5) + 0x19CA)</TT>

<BR><TT>RetCode1 = 0xFDC2</TT>

<BR><TT>You can see that if one of the 3 last RetCodes is wrong, it will

clearly send you on the Bad_Guy#2.</TT>

<BR><TT>But it will discreetly set the Bag_guy#1 flag (mov esi,1) if the

first RetCode is wrong and will go ahead as if everything was fine before

checking it later at offset 422B2F.</TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp;</TT>

<P><TT>This time, the program will read a block from the dongle, and check

if no error occured (RetCode3)</TT>

<BR><TT>We could think that the <I>mov eax,1</I> is our Good_Guy because

right above, it checks the RetCode3 (equal to 0x0 if no error) and jump

if an error was returned.</TT>

<BR><TT>But it stores this RetCode into Eax (:422D13) and later will store

it into Esi too, and will check both registers to see if it's OK. It is

clear that, if the dongle was connected, the program should never reach

offset :422CF4.</TT>

<BR><TT>0xEA is probably a byte calculated somewhere depending on the dongle

RetCode (it is not RetCode1, 2, 3 or 4).&nbsp; To crack this will have

to store 0xEa into ebp+2 and to ensure that the RetCode3 will be equal

to 0x0.</TT>

<BR>&nbsp;



<P><TT>Now, Micro-Cap V seems to work fine but it still check for the dongle

depending on which key is pressed.</TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp;</TT>



<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>The 5th break</U>:</FONT></TT>



<P><TT>Here, the program will check again Service#1 (IsHasp) but in another

location.</TT>



<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>The 6th break</U>:</FONT></TT>



<P><TT>Now it calls again Service 2.</TT>

<BR><TT>Depending on the value of Esi ( 0x<FONT COLOR="#000000">0382, 0x86E4,

0x0799 or 0x053E) the program will check for different RetCodes (they all

are shown in the code) and if it's OK, will clear Eax (Good_Guy) otherwise

will make you jump to offset :422D47.</FONT></TT>

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#000000">If Esi has a different value (this shouldn't

happen) the program will get to the Good_Guy as well.</FONT></TT>

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#000000">To crack this, we will simply xor Ecx (on

the stack as it is saved there before the call to the Hasp routine) during

a call to Service 2 and therefore we will always reach our Good_Guy. Clearing

Ecx will not affect the call to Service 2 I described before this one as

it is unused (saved on the stack).</FONT></TT>

<BR><TT>Here, the program just check if any error occured.&nbsp;</TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp;</TT>

<BR><TT>There are still few xrefs to the main Hasp routine (services 1,

6...) but it doesn't matter as we will 'emulate' the dongle and this will

work for thoses xrefs as well. However, one of them is a call to service

0x29 (HaspID) at offset :422BF6 that apparently the program doesn't reach.

We will not crack it.</TT>

<BR>&nbsp;



<P><TT>As there's not enough room in the main Hasp routine to write our

own one, we will do it mostly at offset :514E4F0 that is called by this

routine:</TT>

<BR><B>-Description:</B>

<BR>High performance image processing and image analysis system.

<BR><B>-OS:</B>

<BR>Win95/NT

<BR><B>-Protection:</B>

<BR>Dongle (parallel or serial key). Driver: <I>Hardlock.vxd</I> (c:\windows\system).

<BR><B>-Misc.:</B>

<BR>Run as a DEMO if no dongle detected (Save, save as, copy disabled,

macros disabled after 30 program runs...).



<P><TT>Described as "seeing the invisible", this is a very sophisticated

and extremely expensive soft. For those reasons, we could only expect a

strong or at least, a good protection. Unfortunately, its protection is

really stupid, and then, the most amazing is that we won't even have to

care about the dongle to crack it!</TT>



<P><TT>During its installation, the program added the file <I>Hardlock.vxd</I>

and told us that we need to restart Windows before running it (to load

the dongle driver!).</TT>



<P><TT>Put a BPIO -H 378 with SoftICE and then run VisionXXL.</TT>

<BR><TT>Nothing happens!&nbsp;</TT> <TT>The program doesn't seem to check

the parallel port.&nbsp;</TT>



<P><TT>After a quick check at the huge documentation (25Mb is MS-Word format!),

I found this:</TT>

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">"The security key can be reversed to be used

on a serial interface port...".</FONT></TT>

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#000000">I read that there are some lines to add to

your <I>Autoexec.bat</I> as well (SET HL_SEARCH=2f8s,...where 2f8 denotes

the IO address of the serial port,and s denotes the serial port. The ellipsis

... is used to indicate that you can check several ports one after the

other.).</FONT></TT>



<P><TT><FONT COLOR="#000000">OK, but let's just forget the dongle for now!</FONT></TT>

<BR><TT><FONT COLOR="#000000">Re-run the program. You'll get the big nagscreen/bitmap

<BR><B>-Description:</B>

<BR>DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) Server allowing other Windows application

programs to access the data from the ABB Procontic CS31 automation system.

<BR><B>-OS:</B>

<BR>Win95/NT

<BR><B>-Protection:</B>

<BR>Dongle (parallel key). Driver: <I>Hasp95.vxd</I> (c:\windows\system).

<BR><B>-Misc.:</B>

<BR>Run as a time-limited DEMO if no dongle detected (will only run 1 hour).

<BR>&nbsp;



<P><TT>At the end of the installation setup, we get a "reboot to activate

HASP driver!" message. So we know where we are and where we going! The

program added the file <I>C:\Windows\System\Hasp95.vxd</I> and the following

line in the Registry: <I>'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\HASP95'</I>.</TT>



<P><TT>With HIEW5.66, we can quickly find the Hasp main routine located

in the <I>Abbcs31.exe</I> file (193Kb).&nbsp;</TT>

<BR><TT>It starts at offset :00001AC9. Now we can BPX it with SoftICE (don't

forget to add 0x400000 to the offset from Hiew to SoftICE ):</TT>

<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp; BPX 401AC9</TT>



<P><TT>Running ABBCS32, we'll get 3 breaks. Callers are:</TT>

<BR><TT>:401C9D</TT>

<BR><TT>:401D0C</TT>

<P><TT>This routine is <B>INCREDIBLY STUPID</B>!!</TT>

<BR><TT>As I said at the very beginning of this essay, the programmer just

forgot to read the Hasp documentation shipped with his dongle:</TT>

<BR><TT>Usually, you first check if there is a Hasp dongle connected to

the parallel port (Service #1) and then, if there is one, the type of Hasp

(Service #5).</TT>

<BR><TT>We can see here that the program check the type of Hasp before

verifying if there is a dongle connected.</TT>

<BR><TT>And so?</TT>

<BR><TT>The only problem is that we can see that ABBCS32 is expecting a

Hasp-3 dongle (RetCode2=0). But, after a call to Service #5, if you <U>don't

have any dongle connected</U> the RetCode2 will be equal to... 0x00 as

well!</TT>

<BR><TT>This just means that if you have the correct dongle or nothing

at all, the program will just assume that you have the right Hasp-3! Unbelievable...</TT>

<BR><TT>Fortunately, it checks Service #1 later.</TT>

<BR>&nbsp;



<P><TT>There are a lot of different ways to crack this crap (patching the

Bad_Guy_Flag...) but let's emulate the dongle by reverse engineering the

main Hasp routine again:</TT>

<P><TT>Now if you run the program, it will ask you for your name and company

name to type in. Then, it will take about 12 seconds on a P233 before WellCAD

main window appears on your screen. Let's solve this problem.</TT>

<BR><TT>As there a too many checks and comparisons occuring even before

the calls to the dongle, with SoftICE, BPX the main Hasp routine (:44D528)

and try to find some interesting cross references that we'll lead us to

the fatal(s) <I>jnz_Bad_Guy.</I></TT>

<BR><TT>Without any problem, we find several of them but only 2 seem very

interesting:</TT>

<P><TT>Just get rid of the two <I>Verify_Dongle</I> calls and replace them

with <I>mov eax,1</I>.&nbsp;</TT>



<P><TT>This will considerabely speed up the program (just 1 little second

to start) and the crack is done.&nbsp;</TT>

<BR><TT>OK, it seems very easy to crack but it takes longer that you may

think. The protection is not too bad: a lot of calls to sub-routines that

will call other sub-routines etc.. and then comparisons in one of them

with the conditional jump in another one... It may fool or confuse you

during a Live approach, but could not resist a good Dead listing.</TT>
