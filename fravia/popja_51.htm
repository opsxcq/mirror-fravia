I'm very happy to present you this VERY USEFUL essay by +Popjack, a 

good teacher for visual basic matters (we host his very good <A href="popja2.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/popja2.htm">

Reverse Engineering VBX Custom Controls</A> essay) that to-day will  

teach us in an extremely clear manner how easy it is to 

reverse OCX controls licensing systems. This will not wonder my readers: 

it is a well know reversing paradox: <FONT color="blue">the more overbloated the language 

used for a protection scheme, the 

more easy it is to tackle it &quot;from underneath&quot; and cut its belly

me:</I></CENTER><PRE><FONT color="purple">Well Fravia+, as promised here comes my essay on OCX controls. It really

this is sadly very true... until we'll have a more mature society, where each one will

some tricks to 

&quot;reverse&quot; the trend and take (at least in part) control of the 

time we need... and eliminating the

In this essay my focus is more on the general concepts of ocx licensing 

control and less on

code listings.

So I want to give away FOR FREE some of my humble knowledge. I write 

this hoping that my readers will 

not just copy what they find in here, I hope that many will <U>start</U> 

working using these basis so that we'll all be able to use their 

knowledge to go further and further on our beautiful paths. 

Remember the old chineese/ORCish saying: Don't give a man a fish. Teach him how 

to fish instead.

<!-- PASTE HERE YOUR INTRODUCTION -->

OCX controls have replaced their VBX counterparts as software 

components to be added to the main applications. The reason is 

that OCX controls can use 32 bit technology while VBX controls 

can't.

These controls need to be registered so that the OS can be aware of 

them. That's why they have all some self registering functions built 

inside. But this doesn't mean we can use them whenever we want to. 

For example a control can be used as a part of an application in some 

machine but will not load in the user programming environment (Visual 

Basic for instance) because a licensing scheme, used by the control, 

prevents him to do so.

The reason is that when we try to use a control that uses a licensing 

procedure it will try to find some specific information in our machine. 

If it is not there the control doesn't get loaded.

During the application execution the control can be loaded because 

the application carries inside the necessary info to give to the control 

and allow its loading. 

In brief, let's say that the application generates some lic info or 

lic key (look for RequestLicKey, CreateInstanceLic and GetLicInfo in 

the target's control).

We will see now two examples.



Example1: Using a LIC file

Target: Fountain.ocx

Where to find: <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.soe.bcit.bc.ca/ocx/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.soe.bcit.bc.ca/ocx/'" tppabs="http://www.soe.bcit.bc.ca/ocx/">http://www.soe.bcit.bc.ca/ocx/</A>

When we place the control in a form, an ocx malfunction pops a 

nagscreen which makes one loose its concentration. 

Very disturbing...

So we need to find out what went wrong.

Let's start with a bpx dialogbox (just to start fishing). 

We load the control in the Visual Basic environment and bang... 

We pop into Softice at 0001.1677:

:0001.1686 CA0400                 retf 0004



Scrolling up the code we soon find the location where the decision 

is taken. The dead list doesn't give us enough info so we place a 

bpx at 0001.164B to trace from that point on and understand the jne

at 0001.165C (yes, we felt it, but we want to <U>understand</U>).

After doing some tracing around this point we see that after all the 

problem is that a license file called Fountain.lic with a string 

inside seem to be curiously missing.

Ok we can take care of that, in order to avoid further interruptions 

in our programming and/or reversing activities,by preparing a simple 

LIC file with the required string.

Make a note of it: this call to <FONT color="blue">OC25.dll Ord{027Eh}</FONT> is found in 

many controls that implement such simple licensing scheme. 

The reason is that this procedure is generated automatically by the

control building wizard. Of course the programmer can (and should)

override such a simple verification in order to make things at least 

a little harder. 

Anyway I've used this approach of searching the dead list for this 

call and I can tell you that it works. Simply modify the routine 

0x27E inside OC25.dll (keep a 'sound copy of it as OC25.ori) in 

order to get always ax=1 as a return value and all these targets 

won't bother you anymore with OCX with their funny license files.



Example2: Using the registry or a lic file

Target: Vsocx.ocx

Where to find: <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.videosoft.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.videosoft.com/'" tppabs="http://www.videosoft.com/">http://www.videosoft.com</A>



Ok, let's install the OCX control using the setup prog included in the 

evaluation pack.

Now in the VB environment we try to load the control using the Custom 

Control menu dialog.

The control appears in the control toolbox. Everything seems to be 

fine... 

When we place one of the 3 controls that come within vsocx we get a 

nag screen telling us where to call to get a registered version. 

That's a bug of course, because this screen is supposed to be shown 

only when we click the about button in the properties window.

So we are here to fix this misplaced call.

As this window does not seem to be a messagebox, so we place a bpx 

dialogbox and wait to see what we fish. 

Unload the control clearing the checkbox on the custom controls menu 

and check it again to get it again in the controls toolbox. 

We try to place the control in the form and ..bang! into Softice we

go.

After some F12's we find ourselves in vsocx16.

  The code at this place doesn't feel interesting so we scroll up to 

the begining of this rotine where we place a bpx at the very beginning, 

in order to use  the stack command next time we come by.

Make a note of it: Call OC25.Ord{011Bh} followed by call OC25.Ord{0373h} 

are <FONT color="blue">used in about boxes</FONT>. 

Once more we unload and load the control into the VB toolbox; place the 

control in a form... bum!

Back into Softice, at our own breakpoint. 

Now we do a <FONT color="blue">stack command</FONT>. 

Note that from the dead list we also get the caller!

This is where we are:



:0002.1EAC FF7608                 push word ptr [bp+08]

:0002.1EAF 56                     push si

:0002.1ECD CA1000                 retf 0010





What controls the unwanted call? 

Obviously the cmp word ptr [0D52]

Is it written somewhere during the loading of the control?

Let's find out with a bpm ds:0d52

Unload and load the control bl· bl· bl·...

Aha! Now this is interesting...

The control is trying to open a registry key. If not found it proceeds to the next check. So we place a bpx on location 0001:B9ED and trace from that point on. Ok, at B9FC we are done. Like +ORC says its more than enough, thank you. We edit the registry and add a key 87CFB907-3C1D-11d0-8ACC-44455354000 under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Licenses (or we can prepare a reg file with this key). Make a note of it: License info resides in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Licenses But what happens if this check fails? Look at what we have next to the above snippet: | :0001.BA24 833E520D00 cmp word ptr [0D52], 0000 :0001.BA29 7529 jne BA54 :0001.BA2B 9AB7A30000 call OC25.Ord{0985h} :0001.BA30 8EC2 mov es, dx :0001.BA32 8BD8 mov bx, ax :0001.BA34 26FF7708 push word ptr es:[bx+08] :0001.BA38 1E push ds :0001.BA39 684B04 push 044B 'vsocx.lic :0001.BA3C 1E push ds 'VideoSoft vsOcx :0001.BA3D 683B04 push 043B :0001.BA40 6AFF push FFFF :0001.BA42 9AFFFF0000 call OC25.Ord{027Eh} :0001.BA47 0BC0 or ax, ax :0001.BA49 7409 je BA54 :0001.BA4B B80100 mov ax, 0001 :0001.BA4E A3520D mov word ptr [0D52], ax 'Flag don't show nag :0001.BA51 A3500D mov word ptr [0D50], ax :0001.BA54 B80100 mov ax, 0001 :0001.BA57 1F pop ds :0001.BA58 C9 leave :0001.BA59 CA0400 retf 0004 Seeing this I understand what +ORC was speaking about when he talked about feeling the code. Can you see (feel) it? :0001.BA42 9AFFFF0000 call OC25.Ord{027Eh} <-- our old friend 27E It is the string that is supposed to be found in a valid license file! Remember what I said earlier about the OC25.Ord{027Eh} call? Some other controls I found use instead "Cinderella" protection schemes that can be pinpointed with the usual approach of GetSystemTime and related API calls. </prE>

<!-- PASTE HERE YOUR FINAL NOTES (if any) -->

<PRE>

OCX controls seem to be poorly protected from what we have 

seen here. 

There are of course several ways to pinpoint these components. 

Instead of showing you a way to get along with a specific control 

I want to give you a general idea of the concepts regarding ocx 

licensing control from the point of vue of a +HCU study. 

We will see in the near future more interesting things to work on, 

like digital signatures of activeX controls, which are dowloaded 

by all web browsers when they show some html pages. 



Thanks to +ORC and the +HCU fellows, who taught me 99% of what 

I know. Well... I've also learned something by myself I must say.

I thank again Fravia+ for maintaining his site with such powerful 

information, and a special thanks goes to +ReZiDeNt for his help.
