<I>Granted, I'm gambling. Publishing this essay (that has been of course sent 

anonymously to me) I'm taking a gamble. I just trust that my readers are like 

me: impervious to the obvious scourges and yet fully 

open to any "sarcastical reversing", even if as "heavy" as this one...<BR><BR>

Unfortuntaley I have already experienced (for minor offences :-) that many 

many readers take things way too seriously... yet I do not! And see: 

that's the only reason I'm publishing this: it's great fun, it is very well

 written (it is of course a troll, see my <A href="enemy.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/enemy.htm">enemy.htm</A> section, and the 

complete exegesis of the first part of this text below... 

yet who cares?, A well written troll is a troll worth reading!) and it is a 

first essay in what I hope will be my 'text cracking' section, maybe  

not as useful as our <A href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm">reality cracking</A> 

essays in order to survive, but -I am sure- very useful in order to stalk our 

friends and enemies on the web.<BR><BR>

So let it be published (and -oh boy!- I had some serious reserves about 

this)... let's see if we have or not enough "reversing might" as not to take 

any offence from it... and let's see, above all, if we can <FONT color=red>use it</FONT> in 

order to tackle a fascinating aspect of reverse engineering that has been almost 

forgotten in the last 50 years... text-exegesis (more about this at the bottom, 

after you'll have read Gossip's text)<BR>

<BR>Anyway I hope that my readers <U>did</U> read Swift's most famous 

book: 'A Modest 

proposal'... Irish undernourished parents should eat their kids, because this 

would solve at once the famine AND the overpopulation problem... written more 

than a century ago... and quite 'strong' from a surreality cracking standpoint... <BR>

Man, I love this kind of reversing (and I don't believe it is so much different from code 

reversing after all :-)<BR>Look at the introduction (technically <I>apostrophe</I>): "<FONT color=purple>Dear 

+HCUkers and fellow necrophiliacs</FONT>" this is 

a classical masterpiece of rethorical deceiving... Hey, hey, are you still there? Ok: 

here you go with this new "troll cracking" masterpiece  :-)

</I>

 <HR></CENTER>

<H4>

<BR><BR>

Dear +HCUkers and fellow necrophiliacs,

<BR><BR>

After spending a significant number of hours browsing through the

kernel update of the much overbloated Win98 (now cracked and available

everywhere), I decided to relax at around one in the morning and

strolled down to the funeral home a few blocks away from my flat. After

selecting what appeared to be a normal (but freshly dead) 10- or

11-year-old girl in a rather exquisite mahogany casket, I fucked her

fishy body for approximately fifteen minutes (screaming out Bill Gates'

name just about every other minute :-) and was suddenly inspired by the

reality that most conventional protections against catching disease

from rotting flesh are ineffectual at best. (Could there be "hidden

protections"?) So, I considered the healths of my fellow HCU buddies,

including +ORC, and decided to write the following up. (HCUers, watch

out for a coming section related to corpse-humping at fravia.org!

Believe me, you haven't lived until you've had sex with as much

lubricant as you want! Going to a 

 hooker is nothing compared to this. :-)

<BR><BR>

-----

<BR><BR>

I: Introduction 

<BR><BR>

Very few text files have been written regarding the sexual tendencies

and practices of necrophiliacs. While most people would prefer to

believe that we do not exist we most certainly do as is obvious to

anyone who visits a cemetery during our nightly rampages. Necrophiliacs

prefer to go about their business alone; sharing is not a part of this

alternative lifestyle as the corpse usually wears out fairly quickly.

This is not to say that the occasional orgy involving four or five

necrophiliacs and about a dozen or so corpses does not occur, but it is

very rare. In this file I will describe common (and some uncommon)

techniques which necrophiliacs use to gain satisfaction from their

stiff partners. Hopefully these vivid descriptions will encourage you

to go out to your local cemetery and to join our ranks! 

<BR><BR>

II: Finding a partner 

<BR><BR>

Finding a partner for your necrophiliac activities is definitely the

hardest part. You not only have to gain access to the corpse but you

also have to find one which suits your tastes. Granted, some

necrophiliacs would screw roadkill if given the chance but most of us

are more discriminating. Your chances depend upon where you pick up

your date. If you have access to a morgue it would definitely be your

best bet as the corpses there are usually the freshest and have not yet

been treated for burial. They may be a bit chilly because they've been

lying in the meat locker for days but that really shouldn't make a big

difference to the determined necrophiliac. Cemeteries are a bit harder

to deal with as finding a screwable corpse is harder to do. However, if

you know how to interpret signs this shouldn't be a problem. If a grave

consists of a mound of fresh dirt and is covered with flowers, chances

are that the stiff hasn't been laying here for too long. Rotting

flowers on the mound usually hint to the state of the corpse as well. Some people are

exclusively into 'porking the bone', i.e. sex with skeletons. In this

case you can dig up almost any grave and hope that the inhabitant

hasn't yet disintegrated into dust. Try to scope out a fairly secluded

cemetery for your passions unless you like a sense of danger to go

along with the sex. Having anyone catch you in the act is NOT fun, and

if you're picked up by a cop chances are that you won't be able to

screw anything but Bubba behind bars for the next few decades. People

are generally not understanding of the necrophiliac lifestyle, so it

will probably be a long time before we can come out of the closet. 

<BR><BR>

III: Preparation 

<BR><BR>

Depending upon where you are at this point you'll have either a little

or a lot of work to do. The person in the morgue will obviously have to

do little more than to open the locker, pull the corpse out and bang

away. If you're one of the cemetery people you'll have more work to do.

An experienced necrophiliac is always equipped with the bare

essentials: a shovel, vaseline and a box of rubbers. Why the shovel is

needed should be obvious, but if the ground is hard then you might need

more equipment to dig up your date. Vaseline is used to loosen the

corpse up a bit. This makes it less likely for a body part to break off

while you're having fun and it also prevents your mantool from becoming

too irritated while screwing the dried out pussy. The BOX of condoms is

used to play it safe; no necrophiliac should be without it. You never

know which STDs your partner had during his/her lifetime, and believe

me, it doesn't get any better after the person dies. You can put on

more than one rubber for extra protection if it is warranted, but screwing a corpse

without protection is just plain stupid unless you want to be the next

date for a necrophiliac. If you're in a cemetery try to drag the corpse

out of the grave and behind a bush or to another secluded place.

Pumping away in the grave may seem more convenient, but it's a severe

disadvantage to you if you need to take off in a hurry. Sometimes the

corpse is too fragile to be moved; in that case make it fast. Or just

break off the head, hand or lower torso and take it with you for added

convenience. 

<BR><BR>

Part IV: Techniques 

<BR><BR>

So now you've got a stiff lying seductively in front of you, but you

have no idea how to start. How you proceed from this point onward

really depends upon what kind of person you are. The corpse will last

longer if you treat it gently and with care, but if you prefer to go

all out you'll probably receive greater satisfaction. There are many

differences between screwing a live and a dead person which one needs

to be aware of. Firstly, a corpse will never tell you to get off of it

if you're being a bit rough and it will never complain no matter what

kinky sexual practices you use it for. Screwing a corpse is also much

more predictable because you can raise an arm, leg or whatever and it

will still be in that position when you reach for it again. Take the

arms and gently lock them in an embrace behind your back, or spread the

legs to make sex a bit easier. If you want a great blowjob then

lubricate your partner's mouth, lock it to your preferred width, insert

and go for it. Although there's no tongue stimulation it's still worthwhile, and it's also

safer than conventional sex. Corpses can also be recycled if treated

properly. If you're a proficient embalmer you can keep a corpse for

over five years if it has been properly embalmed. That's free sex

whenever you want it! You naturally don't want to be too rough with an

embalmed corpse though as they are more fragile. One final advantage of

screwing corpses is that they are always in abundance. Based upon your

sexual preferences you can designate a cemetery or a morgue as your

territory and always find fresh partners to screw. Plus you don't have

to resort to cheesy pickup lines or spend all your money in order to

get a date. Necrophilia is a passion which is cheaply satisfied. 

<BR><BR>

V. Conclusion 

<BR><BR>

I hope that this text file will encourage you to go out and try

necrophilia. Not many people do it, but that's precisely what makes it

so much fun; it makes you feel special! If no living person would touch

you with a 10 foot pole then try having sex with a corpse! Some of them

are real beauties and it's an experience you'll never forget. There is

no greater experience for a virgin than having his/her virginity taken

by a corpse. Anyways, have fun and if you have any experiences you'd

like to share then by all means do! Maybe necrophilia will enter the

mainstream because of your efforts.

<H3>Exegesis of this text</H3><BR></CENTER>

Of course I cannot leave  this opportunity for a small 'reversing' attempt of the 

intentions and aims of the Anonymous Author that did send me this text... after all 

I'm (supposed to be) a reverser...<BR><BR>I would like to take this opportunity 

in order to (try to) start a whole new 'lab' on my site: Text-exegesis, or, if you 

prefer, text-cracking. In a world where Internet is playing a continuously greater 

role, the might of the written text (as opposed to the might of the visual frills and 

of voices) is increasing in parallel. In the last 50 years, with humans 

overwhelmed by so many radiofonic, telephonic and televisual

'visual' stimuli, the great (old) arts of text reversing have seldom found in 

universities and research groups the place they do deserve. This will now of course change, 

thanks Internet, and since we are able to see what will happen before others do (don't 

remember that we are reversers :-) we may as well give our own small 

contribution.<BR><BR>I'll apply it right now to Gossip's text. here we go:<HR>

<BR><FONT color=purple>

Dear +HCUkers and fellow necrophiliacs,

<BR></FONT>

The opening is a classic 'troll' shocker. The rhetorical 

trick is called <I>exsuscitatio</I> and is here part of this <I>apostrophe</I>



<BR><FONT color=purple>

After spending a significant number of 

hours browsing through the kernel update 

of the much overbloated Win98 (now cracked 

and available everywhere),

</FONT><BR>Well... who is this guy? A protector? The snippet 

'now cracked 

and available everywhere' is a '<I>digressio</I>' that, like all digressio, can 

be used in order to stalk. The gtone here seems to me rather 'deploring-sad'.

The 'much overbloated' snippet is a '<I>citatio</I>', taken from the many essays 

on my site that accuse windows of overbloatedness, and IMO confirms this 

impression (see below the citatio of +ORC, Gates and my site)...



<BR><FONT color=purple>

I decided to 

relax at around one in the morning and 

strolled down to the funeral home a few 

blocks away from my flat. After

selecting what appeared to be a normal 

(but freshly dead) 10- or 11-year-old girl 

in a rather exquisite mahogany casket, 

</FONT>

<BR>

The whole text presents an iterational character, i.e.: the same 'figura' (here necrophily taken as 

granted) is repeated 

and amplificated continuously. The beginning is here 

particularly iperbolic. Technically this is part of the 'audacior ornatus' 

and is called parresia (or <I>licentia</I>): the Author expresses openly and 

bravely a thesis that can be shocking and could move the public against the 

Author and his message. <BR>Note that  

the chosen corpse is that of a very young girl (note the '10 or 11' 

trick, btw), at once here you have necrophily, pedophily, burglary (the 

funeral home is supposedly closed at 'one in the morning') and 

a general well created 'Draculian' athmosfere (cfr the 'mahogany' 

casket touch :-) 



<BR><FONT color=purple>

I fucked her fishy body for approximately 

fifteen minutes (screaming out Bill Gates'

name just about every other minute :-) and 

was suddenly inspired by the reality that 

most conventional protections against 

catching disease from rotting flesh are 

ineffectual at best. (Could there be "hidden

protections"?)</FONT><BR>

The opening snippet 'fucked her fishy body' of this period are not 

neutralized by the more ironical "Gates screaming" part and represent 

the central vivid image  

that the Author transmits. This is a <I>hypotiposys</I>: the 

vivid, almost 'visual' description of a subject. The ancient greeks (that 

did not have any television) had developed this rethoric art to a point 

where a good speaker could have the audience see the colors, feel the 

surfaces and smell the scents just by choosing the right words... and you 

thought that virtual reality was new?

<BR><FONT color =purple>



So, I considered the healths 

of my fellow HCU buddies, including +ORC, and 

decided to write the following up. (HCUers, 

watch out for a coming section related to 

corpse-humping at fravia.org!

Believe me, you haven't lived until you've 

had sex with as much lubricant as you want! 

Going to a hooker is nothing compared to 

this. :-)</FONT>

<BR>Any good stalker and text-reverser should 

immediatly see a warning red light in presence of 

verbs like 'humping'.  This is a specific slang for 

'to having sexual intercourse with someone' and it is 

definitely NOT a verb that a non-anglophone would or 

could use. 'my fellow HCU buddies' is clearly 

'tactic action irony' and confirms what we suspected above with 

the 'now cracked and available everywhere' snippet.

'Lubricant' is here methonimical for lubricous. 

'Hooker' is another hypotiposis, here used as a 'closing rehorical uppercut'.

<BR>

<FONT color=purple>

I: Introduction<BR>Very 

few text files have been written regarding the sexual tendencies and 

practices of necrophiliacs...</FONT><BR>

The tone and the style changes. The following part has been written by 

another (much more educated) person. There are no references whatsoever to my 

site or cracking anymore. The <I>genus demonstrativum</I> is far superior to the 

Author of the apostrophe and snippets like '<FONT color=purple>There are many

differences between screwing a live and a dead person which one needs to be aware 

of.</FONT>' have an 'understatement' rhetorical 

power that differs completely from what we have seen in the apostrophe. Therefore I will 

not apply any reversing microanalysis to this part of the text.<BR><BR>

Conclusions: A somewhat acid american reader (unfortunately the link given in his email 

does not work) that has found somewhere and sent a 

very nice satirycal snippet as a 'provocation' towards the kind of anti-windoze's 

writings he has found (and read) on my site. This impression is 

confirmed also by his concluding pun '<FONT color=purple>fravia.org(asm)</FONT>' (which 

 technically is called a <I>paronomasia</I>... btw I strongly advice those among you interested 

in "text cracking" to learn 

the most common rhetorical figures... no advertisement whatsoever (nor politician 

promise :-) will ever have any grasp on you afterwards... <A href="howtosea.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howtosea.htm">seek</A> for 'rhetorical devices', 

'rhetorical structures', 'Plato's early dialectic', 'Toposforschung', 'Rhetorik',

 'Use of fallacy', 'Art of Persuasion', 'Theologie der Sprache', 'Dialogtecnik' and 

so on in any good search engine and you'll be embarked on a two years (at least) wonderful 

knowledge trip!

<BR>The whole text sent by Gossip, taken alltogether, for those of you that are not yet bored to death and 

are still interested, is a classical 

example of <I>ductus subtilis</I>, where the Author simulates an opinion (<I>thema</I>: here 

the necrophilic attitude) with a concealed aim (<I>consilium</I>): to obtain 

in his audience a quite different effect, in this case a reflection about the 

absurd dimensions that any 'apparently logical' DIY booklet (introduction ~ finding a 

partner ~ preparation ~ conclusion) can obtain... of course the Author does not expect readers 

to have sexual intercourses with dead corpses after having read his text, duh.<BR>The whole piece is therefore an ironical 

simulation (exactly like Swift's 'A modest proposal') know also as <I>dissimulatio</I>. The paradox 

is the typical tool used for these aims ("L'important... n'est pas que cette fa¡on 

de raisonner soit bonne, mais qu'elle fasse r»fl»chir", Camus).<BR>At times 

I wonder if this could

also apply to our software reverse engineering essays...

<BR><BR>

Awaiting your corrections/contributions/ameliorations...
