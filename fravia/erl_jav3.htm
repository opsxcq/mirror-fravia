Lately, many of our more industrious and investigative interpreters have taken it upon themeselves to supply fravia's site with documents which purport to explain and/or illuminate the origin of a project which we believed to be a wholly unique reversing endeavour: namely, the production of the pages which you now casually finger.
Yet, to our horror, we discover that (alas) this section apparently has had some predecessors, a sobering fact to which the brief but informative squibs arranged above attest.
In light of this new discovery, the editors gently wish to make it known that they claim no 'squatter's rights' regarding this pre-ordained intellectual territory, but are interested only in the free dissemination of this kind of knowledge. 
Welcome to the new java section of mys ite, dear reders, scouting into java will be assured by my dogg Earl, maybe the only person I know of that can describe in writings an altavista search.

I've got so many links, I don't know what to do with them.  I guess I'd better ask my Sister of the Animal Persuasion, the Library Cat. <br>
She's systematic. symptomatic? one of those.  Let's see if we can get all the great links on one page.

Links are forever.  Can never get enough.  But let's say, I didn't want to see 
everything, just what I wanted to see.  How would you do that?

Library Cat says, &quot;Dewey Decimal System. Store like things alike and give them
a number.  Within the number you range them from east to west, and conglomeration 
to esoteric, and give them bigger numbers.  Within the bigger numbers you arrange 
them alphabetically by author, well, by committee, well, by chairman, well by town... 
I don't know. I'm new here.  Ask a postman.  They've got more regulations  than 
we do.&quot;

Ok.  We'll put like things alike and give them a number.  I don't see what good 
that's going to do, but maybe it will occur to me once I've done it.

What were the categories of old Alexandria,  mathematics music medicine language and 
slavery?

Oh, I get it!  She never does find things again.  She just remembers where she put 
them.  She Categorizes them!  Smart, that Library Cat.  The numbers are there just 
because the books are in a regulatory agency - a jail.  Forget the numbers, where's 
the Cat?

What should be the categories of our links page, so at the desk the Library Cat 
could point to the big sign, like in a grocery store, and say... right down 
that aisle, midway, to the left, down at the bottom, alphabetically by mouse.

Maybe we won't get it quite right, but here we go:  Yet Another Guide to the Universe 
of Java; YAGUJ.  Presumably it works like a game room.  You don't want to see the other 
end of the trophy right now,  To do that, you'll walk down the hall and go into the next 
room.

Just a word about style.  Didn't you find the Marty Hall double column pages confusing

distracting like a toy store?  And van der Linden lazy like a bicycle shop?  And the 
big sites bland like Bing Crosby?  And this page just endless like a tyke on a trike?  

I vote for Meurrens as most useful.  And van der Linden as most wise.  And McGraw and

Our next Zen misstep, our next nez trail, is to follow Meurrens links, follow Kimera's 
links, and read McGraw and Felten, and follow their security links.

Oh, -Boojum wants us to look at Jini - How to get your toys to do what you want your 
toys to do!  And we should ask some gamers questions.  And More Book Links! 

Til then, duke, flash your badges!  All forty-two of them!
