Fravia's thoughts (April-May 1999)<BR>



OK, so I have taken some decisions during the long (forced) interruption of my 

on-line presence due to the syn-attacks against my fortress.<BR><BR>

<A href="aca400.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/aca400.htm">Software cracking</A><BR>

No more 'targeted' software cracking articles or essays, i.e., nothing more that could economically 

damage a given programmer. The 'software cracking' (historical) part of my 'frozen' old site will still 

be there, unless someone should legitimately ask me to remove any specific older essay. In that 

case I will most probably comply and remove it.<BR>

From now on I'll publish only 'target unrelated', 'concealed activities' and 'older 

protections' software cracking articles.<BR><BR>

<A href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm">Reality cracking</A><BR>

Will be intensified.<BR><BR>

<A href="howtosea.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howtosea.htm">How to search</A><BR>

Will be intensified.<BR><BR>

<A href="noanon.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/noanon.htm">Anonymity matters</A><BR>

Will be intensified.<BR><BR>

I'll also start a new section: <A href="screamin.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/screamin.htm">screaming truth</A><BR>

All this is just at the beginning, please bear with this confusion for a couple of weeks.

<HR>

The following was written in september 1998<BR>

The section of my site about reversing software protections is about to change 

radically</FONT></CENTER><P><I>In nuce</I>: <FONT color=red>I will not accept nor write any 

more useless "software 

deprotection" essays, I'll publish (and try to write myself) essays about 

software reverse engineering.</FONT>. 

If you already had a look at my site, and at the <A href="academy.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/academy.htm">published 

essays</A> you'll 

understand what I mean, else go ahead, explore my site and come back later.<BR><BR>The development of our techniques, approaches and 

global understanding 

has been huge. We don't need any more to crack software protections 

ourself, it's time we move over to real software reversing... we need 

the software protection cracking (as we always did) only as a 'lure' to get 

young talented 

people on a "reversing path", a road that will transform them into good programmers, 

intelligent 

users, clever minds that will never again be obfuscated by frills and 

useless trends, real humans that will work in order to achieve whatever 

their own (and not somebody else's) wishes are.<BR>Ok, ok, ok: These words -I know- 

 sound kinda funny: "so we'll  

transform people in order to avoid that they get transformed" 

sounds quite scary... contradictory to 

say the least. Yet people that learn how to reverse (software schemes and rhetorical 

patterns as well) will be able 

to easily reverse <U>this very  

 writing</U>, and act consequently 

(note that this holds true <U>whichever</U> reversing path they'll later 

take, white, red or black), 

so they'll be much more 

"safe" against all kind of tricks -once for all- and that's 

exactly what I believe is important.<BR>Besides Master +ORC himself 

wrote a long time ago the following: 

<FONT color=purple> coz people do not want to learn to be

free, and to free them we have sadly to &quot;circumvent&quot; them with more or 

less the same techniques that our enemies use to enslave them :=)</FONT>. And I 

disagree: we may recur to using 'enroll techniques' yet we have 

to use, IMO, <U>different</U> ones: our techniques must be transparent and proudly 

show their 'inner working'. They'll be nevertheless as 

strong as our enemy ones (or even stronger :-) 

yet they'll always be "on the side of the light" and -an added bonus- 

those that want to enslave other 

people 

will never be able to use them (knwoledge and transparence are like sun or garlic  

against all sort of vampires, commercial oriented bastards cannot even touch them without 

getting blisters everywhere :-)

VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=LEFT>

<BR>This said we should anyway, I believe, reduce the "how I cracked this last version 

of this target software" 

essays, because that IS NOT important at all. Besides, 

 I'm fed up with all the little lusers using the knowledge 

they learn on sites like mine in order to produce serial number keygenerators 

or ready made cracks for the zombies instead to grow up and cut the guts out 

of the real dangerous snooping M$ (or whatever) applications that syphon our 

own data from our own computers. The point of what I am doing is to (try to) 

teach people how to understand, control or modify ANY aspect of their 

software whenever they fancy, <U>NOT</U> to damage software programmers for the 

sake of it.<BR>

After so many years 'in the scene' I don't feel any more that what we are 

doing in this field is really useful to grow up people unless we change our approach.<P>



I have thought a little about it, and see some different possible solutions,  

as usual I'll await your input before proceeding:

<P>



<FONT color=blue><B>1</B></FONT>) Completely close the section about reversing software protection schemes, accepting only 

essays about "non protection-related" code reversing (and "compiler specifities"  

reversing); as you know I reckon these kind of papers to be the most interesting, 

together with the essays about 'adding 

functionalities' to a target and about 'hidden activities' of a target... like for 

instance to investigate the concealed connections to a web site of a target 

in order to deliver, without your 

permission, all sort 

of personal data found on your harddisk... cfr many recent Micro$oft's applications... 

besides it is Web-evident that in 

the reversing scene some 

good work on "compared compilology" is sorely missing).<BR>This solution would

 <I>de facto</I>  transform the 'software cracking' 

section in a full fledged 'software investigation' lab and would not have 

anything to do anymore with software deprotection <I>per se</I>.<P>

<IMG SRC="ibvolga.jpg" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ibvolga.jpg" ALT="crossing over" WIDTH=330 HEIGHT=413 BORDER=0 

VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=LEFT>

<FONT color=blue><B>2</B></FONT>) Limit the section about reversing software protection schemes only to outstanding 

essays dealing with new forms of protection schemes, <U>and eliminating 

at the same time 

all references 

to any "specific" target</U>, in this way "real" reversers would be able to see and understand 

the code (and grasp the protection 

scheme used by the unknown target), yet lusers 

would not be able to guess which program or application is the essay referring to.<BR>

This solution would transform the section into a 

"software deprotection and protection lab" very useful for protectors and reversers that 

would NOT damage the software programmers.

<P><FONT color=blue><B>3</B></FONT>) Publish in that section only essays about protection schemes of "older versions" of a specific target, 

i.e.: versions that are NO MORE IN USE (or DOS programs).<BR>This solution would transform the 

section into a sort of "history of the software protection" lab, useful for protectors and 

reversers alike that 

would NOT damage the software programmers.<HR><P>

Of course anyone unhappy with this changement of mine can quickly join one of the good main 

crackers groups, like Phrozen Crew, UCF or Mexelite, where he will find many 

outstanding crackers, able to teach him everything he needs in order to produce 

a zillion of 

keygenerators and patches for the never ending last versions of any application. 

Farewell.<P>

And of course those that only wish to steal software don't need at all to study 

anything at all, nor to follow any of 

the threads above: they will be able to find any serial 

number or patch they may need (in fact every application or game they may want 

to steal) on the billions of warez sites.<P><HR>



<IMG SRC="ibvolga.jpg" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ibvolga.jpg" ALT="crossing over" WIDTH=330 HEIGHT=413 BORDER=0 

VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT>Somehow I feel my site should follow 

a new path, I feel that we should indeed bring knowledge to the masses, but 

that it is a mistake to lean too much on their petty, selfish interest. If someone has 

the will, he will still find  on my site anything he needs -always for free, don't underestimate 

this aspect- to learn and to 'go beyond', yet 

I feel we must shut out all those (and believe me, there are quite many of them) 

that are only faking a vague interest for knowledge in order to transform everything they learn 

into personal gain (the surest way, IMHO, to negate knowledge).<P>

 I'll change my pages quite radically during 

the next months: I intend to cut a lot and create a smaller, yet I hope  

quite interesting, new 'Fravia', that I would like to subdivide in 'labs':<UL>

<LI>"Software reverse engineering" Lab (see above)</LI>

<LI>"Reality cracking" Lab</LI>

<LI>"How to search the web" Lab</LI>

<LI>"Stalking, anonimity and web survival" Lab</LI>

<LI>"Web scripts, site busting and password protection" Lab</LI></UL>

Of course the help and contributions of all my readers (and +friends) are welcome. In the mean time: 

 enjoy the last days of the old Fravia's site... I'm boldly crossing towards new shores on the deep deep 

sea of our Web.

<CENTER><A name="answcom"><HR><H2>Answers & Comments</H2>

(Some daf¸r and some dagegen... OK, I have published nere only a small part, a "choice" from   

all your contributions, yet I thank <U>all</U> those that have given me advice... 

Believe me: I'm taking note of <U>everything</U> you have written)<BR><BR>

<FONT color=blue>I will not comment these contributions. It is not necessary, 

because I believe that the 

correct path will become clear "all by itself", as it always happens 

when people work together 

and contribute. Just read the ones I have published 

(only if you'r interested of course) and I'm sure you'll understand  

what I mean. As usual on this web of ours, light, truth, insights and powerful solution 

proposals come 

from cooperation, friendship, 

and from sound contributions offered by people 

you have never met in your life...</FONT></CENTER>
