You believe hidden manipulation being hooey? Join the club. That is

exactly what big advertisers, major media, politicians,

religious leaders and the various huge commercial corporations want you to

believe. The more you believe that, the longer and more

successfully they can secretly influence your purchasing, and your personal and

political decisions. Governments can do little (if ever) against the commercial 

oligarchs of the planet. We hear very little about these subjects

these days (search the web!), but that is not because there is nothing to talk

about. On the contrary: There is too much. One always

suspects powerful commercial intervention when techniques to abuse

mankind are suddenly banished from discussion. In any event in the last 20 years 

there has been a steadfast denial of

this extraordinary phenomenon by the "experts", yet 

 Dr. Wilson Bryan

Key and his research associates (for instance) have documented hundreds

of cases of embedding in major advertisements, including

ads run by Crest toothpaste, Vaseline, Johnnie Walker Scotch,

Kent cigarettes, Calvert whiskey, Bacardi rum, Sprite, and

Seagram's Gin.

<P>The advertising industry, a prominent and powerful industry, 

engages in deceptive subliminal advertising which most us are unaware

of. By bypassing our unconscious mind using subliminal techniques, advertisers

tap into the vulnerabilities surrounding our unconscious mind, manipulating

and controlling us in many ways. Since the 1940's subliminal advertising

blossomed until now, when you can find subliminals in every major advertisement

and magazine cover. Legislation against the advertisers has had no effect

in curbing the use of subliminals. In this Information Age, it seems people

are no longer in control of the people. The ones in control are the ones

with knowledge (as usual). In this case, the advertisers have it; you don't. <FONT color=blue>Until

<A NAME="_Toc389899935"></A>Foreword</H1>





<P>Advertisements bombard every minute of our lives. The advertising industry

has penetrated into every aspect our this society. When I wake up in the

morning, the first thing I hear is my radio blaring out the latest ad for

Sears or the Penn State Bookstore. At night, the last thing I see is the

latest peroxide innovation on the toothpaste tube. Most of us ignore these

ads as we drive by the Marlboro billboard on the way to work or to the

countryside on a lovely day. However, most of us do not realize the mind

games the advertisers has been playing on our subconscious minds for the

past half century. It's a scary thought, really, when you realize the advertisers

has gained control of our lives without us even knowing it.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899936"></A>Serendipity</H2>

I stumbled onto this topic of subliminal messages in advertisements accidentally.

Before I became familiar with this subject, I have heard of naked women

in ice cubes floating on soft drinks. I have also heard of subliminal messages

being flashed in theaters telling people to drink soda and eat popcorn.

In fact, I have experimented with flashing messages on the&nbsp;<!--Computer program-->computer

screen using a program I made at the beginning of my senior year in computer

science class. The subject of a subconscious mind being influenced without

a person's knowledge greatly intrigues me. At a science symposium I have

attended to present a research poster, I have listened to another presentation

about the effects of subliminal stimuli on the left (logical) side of the

brain. The presenter was off topic and was consequently marked by the judges.

However, she has given me the impulse to further dwell on this topic. Some

questions I have asked as I entered this research was, "Are there really

naked women in ice cubes?" "If so, are they effective in influencing people?"

And finally, "How do the advertisers put these subliminal messages into

their ads?" With these objectives in mind, I have discovered the breadth

of background knowledge I had to gather before I even attempt to analyze

the ads. I had to learn about human perception, subconscious processing,

advertising strategies, depth interviews, graphic design, and a plethora

of sub-topics. Nonetheless, I have thoroughly enjoyed this research project.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899937"></A>In My Defense</H2>

As I read through several of Dr. Wilson Bryan Key's<!--Key, Bryan Wilson-->

books on subliminal advertising, I was amazed and shocked at the amount

of filth and porn in the advertisements. If they were targeted for the

conscious mind, the collection of these ads would turn into your average

amateur hard-core. As I tried to show and explain some of these advertisements

to my colleagues, the first and predominant response I got was "You have

a sick mind." In defense of myself and all of the researchers who have

studied these ads, I must point out that it is the advertisers who printed

the ads. These researchers and I are simply bringing into your consciousness

mind what your unconscious mind has absorbed already. It is easy to hide

away and reject what we don't understand, as the Roman Catholic Church

did to Galileo's theory of the universe. All that I ask is that you look

into these ads and explanation with an open, even if skeptical mind.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899938"></A>Research Biases<!--Biases--></H2>

The existence of a subconscious mind and subliminal perception is still

a controversy today. There is vast evidence for the existence of both,

but the evidence is based on a methodology that is by nature not pure scientific.

Despite the lack of conventional scientific evidence, I believe there exists

a consciousness that lies outside of our normal awareness. Although I will

later provide evidence, the paper assumes the existence of such a phenomenon.

<H1>

<A NAME="_Toc389899939"></A>Introduction</H1>

What is your favorite ad on TV or in a magazine? Why do you like it? Is

it the dry humor? Or the dramatic irony? Advertisers use subliminal techniques

to put hidden messages into their ads. By now, your subconscious mind has

a full load of them, each expertly targeted by the advertisers. Although

the exact consequences are unknown, one can guess it is like being brainwashed

every time you see an ad.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899940"></A>Heaving Breasts</H2>

Do advertisers really put subliminal messages on their ads? Let's explore

this topic. Go to the vending machine and buy a can of Diet CokeÙ. The

can looks pretty ordinary--script letters on white bubbles floating on

a silver can. Turn your attention now to the passion red glass on the lower

left and hold the can arm's-length away from you. Do you see them now?

Almost everyone I have shown the can to readily perceived the sexual image.

Although this is the most blatant example of embedding I have discovered,

Coca-Cola<!--Coca-Cola--> manages to get away with it by placing the image

in an inconspicuous spot on the can, masked by the fizzing bubbles and

bold print. Since Diet Coke is targeted at female consumers, it would seem

illogical to embed female breasts onto the soda can. According to Dr. Wilson

Bryan Key, "male genitalia<!--genitalia--> in ads are usually directed

to male audiences. Female genitalia are directed to females." I will explain

later that subliminal images are most effective when associated with cultural

taboos.

<H1>

<A NAME="_Toc389899941"></A>Subliminal Perception</H1>

Apparently, subliminal perception is not a newly discovered physiological

phenomenon used only by the advertising industry. Historical scholars such

as Plato<!--Plato-->, Aristotle<!--Aristotle-->, and even texts such as

the Bible have alluded to a subconscious phenomenon. Early artists, such

as those in the Renaissance, have used subliminal techniques in their artwork.

Aristotle first documented the relationship between dreams<!--dream-->

and the unconscious mind.



<P>Impulses occurring in the daytime, if they are not very great and powerful,

pass unnoticed because of greater waking impulses.



<P>But in the time of sleep the opposite takes what often happens in sleep;

men think that it is lightning and thundering when there are only faint

echoes in their ears, and that they are enjoying honey and sweet flowers,

when only a drop of phlegm is slipping down their throats.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899942"></A>Definition</H2>

One of the controversies surrounding the existence of subliminal perception

is its definition. Subliminal means "below threshold." An apple placed

in complete darkness would be below the visual threshold for perception.

It is not until the lighting on the apple increases to a sufficient level

for recognition is it considered "above threshold." The minimum stimulation

necessary to detect a particular stimulus (not necessarily recognize),

is called the absolute threshold. However, the required amount of lighting

on the apple for identification is different for everyone, and therefore

what may be subliminal to one person may not be subliminal to another.

It is generally accepted that a perception is subliminal if a great majority

of the audience can not perceive it consciously. So what is perception?

Perception is the brain's reception of incoming stimuli. Dr. Key said perception

is total and instantaneous, but only 1/1000<SUP>th</SUP> of this is consciously

recognized and processed. The rest is either stored in subconscious memory

or dumped as irrelevant information. Although we do not fully understand

how the brain perceives the world, advertisers have no interest in the

motor and gears of the brain. It only cares that the brain is influenced

the most by visual stimulation and there are certain ways to stimulate

the brain without its conscious awareness. Dixon provides a good definition

of subliminal perception, which he words as "subliminal reception."

<OL>

<LI>

The subject responds without awareness to stimulus.</LI>



<LI>

Subject knows he is being stimulated, but doesn't know what it is.</LI>

</OL>

For the rest of the paper, I will use the above definition for subliminal

perception. Subliminal messages will therefore be the transmission of subliminal

content using methods which the brain subconsciously perceives but is not

consciously aware.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899943"></A>Experimental Confirmation</H2>

Since the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century researchers have been performing psychological

tests to confirm the existence of subliminal perception. N. F. Dixon has

compiled over 500 studies on this topic and concluded in his book that

subliminal perceptions exists beyond any reasonable doubt. He said, "It

would seem that reports of percepts may be influenced by stimulation which

the percipient is not aware. Certainly, it can be claimed that the having

of a conscious percept does not exclude the possibility of subliminal effects."

His book is held in such esteem one advertiser quoted "Dixon's book is

basic reading for our creative department. We think of it as an operational

bible." Ironically, Dixon never guessed his work would be used for commercial

exploitation.



<P>Dr. Hal C. Becker has patented a black box from 1962 to 1966 to pipe

audio subliminal messages on top of another audio source. He has used this

black box experimentally in stores to reduce theft and on weight reduction

programs. In the case of the store, which a message such as "Don't steal"

was superimposed into background music, theft in the store dropped 37%.

However, he has urged caution in the use of such device and keep an eye

on "other uses." Since his device is in patent, any company can look up

the design and build a similar device to influence the population. Who

knows, they may already by using it at every TV broadcasting station.



<P>In 1983, an average class of Tucson eighth graders have taken a self

esteem test on processed paper with subliminal messages on it. Students

who have taken the test on paper printed with the subliminal message of

"YOU ARE LOVED" have scored 15% higher than the students who have taken

test on plain paper. The same test given to underachievers have produced

even more remarkable results-the students scored 34.7% higher on processed

paper. Dana Osman, president of Osman-Kord, Ltd., the company who printed

the paper, claims that subliminal messages only work to influence minor

decisions, and they are the most powerful when reinforcing an already made

decision.



<P>Researchers have designed tests to quantitatively measure the physiological

responses of the body while subjected to subliminal stimuli. The researchers

connect sensitive instruments to the subject while they are asked to watch

a blank screen periodically superimposed with emotional subliminal stimuli.

Tachistoscope projectors, which can flash words or images onto the screen

with a duration of several milliseconds, are used to display the stimuli.

Although the subject reports to having no awareness of the stimuli, researchers

found they can alter the brain's alpha and theta waves, detected using

an electroencephalograph (EEG). Similarly, they can detect subtle variations

in heart rate using EKG's and higher electrical potentials on the skin

using GSR's.



<P>It is clear that humans can be affected by subliminal stimuli without

their conscious awareness. The understanding of the our brain is too limited

to understand how or why this works. However, the advertisers don't care

about the inner workings of the brain. They only care that the population

can be influenced and they have the resources to do the influencing.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899944"></A>Physiological Feasibility</H2>

While there are centuries of experimental proof to back the existence of

subliminal perception, the argument could be made much stronger if there

exists scientific theories of human physiology to support the case. Unfortunately,

our medical research has only begun to tap into the inner workings of the

human brain. There are some theories which could provide support. From

an evolutionary standpoint, our brains have not always had the same level

of consciousness as we do now. It can be theorized from animals living

today that their consciousness is controlled more from automatic responses

and unconsciousness behavior. Dixon contends that when our brain has evolved

from unconscious processing to conscious awareness, the brain has developed

control mechanisms to filter most of the sensory input. To fully utilize

the limited consciousness, and to protect the brain from sensory overload,

only a fraction of the sensory input is channeled into the conscious mind.

The rest is processed by our unconscious mind. Dixon writes:



<P>It is contended that the principles of physiological summation, inhibition,

and facilitation, the notion of interactions between specific and non-specific

effects, and the existence of centrifugal-centripetal "gating" loops within

the central nervous system, provide all that is necessary for a viable

theory, without recourse to any concept that is anthropomorphic or supernatural.



<P>In other words there is physiological basis for the possibility of subliminal

perception, but the research is not thorough enough to prove its existence.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899945"></A>Arguments Against</H2>

As with every theory, there are people who argue against subliminal perception.

Some are intellectuals, but curiously, the loudest and strongest voices

come from the advertisers. The most often used argument against this phenomenon

is that it is "inherently unlikely, anthropomorphic, unparsimonious, physiologically

inexplicable, and based upon shaky methodology." There are many plausible

reasons why people vehemently deny the existence this phenomenon. According

to Dixon, people instinctually fear what they do not know. We live in a

country where personal freedom is one of the founding principles of this

democratic society. To admit to an unconsciousness is to admit to the fact

that there are areas of our brain that we can not control, but others can

without our knowledge. The resistance is explicated.

<H1>

<A NAME="_Toc389899946"></A>Human Psychology</H1>

Before one can understand the subliminal techniques advertisers use to

influence the audience, one must understand the vulnerabilities in humans

they tap into. The human being is a complex creature. The same complexity

that gives us the ability to manipulate objects also makes us vulnerable

to manipulation. Once the advertisers find these vulnerabilities (and they

have done extensive research), there is little the public can do defend

themselves against the onslaught.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899947"></A>Consciousness</H2>

It is generally accepted that we possess various levels of consciousness.

For example, the state of consciousness while we dream is different from

the state when we are awake. Packard has distinguished the consciousness

into three levels.



<P>Conscious-rational level, where people know what is going on, and are

able to tell why. The second and lower level is called, variously, preconscious

and subconscious but involves that area where a person may know in a vague

way what is going on within his own feelings, sensations, and attitudes

but would not be willing to tell why. This is the level of prejudices,

assumptions, fears, emotional promptings and so on. Finally, the third

level is where we not only are not aware of our true attitudes and feelings

but would not discuss them if we could.



<P>Advertisers use subliminal techniques to influence the second and third

level of consciousness. They target the consumer's fears and desires, manipulating

them in ways never thought possible. On the other hand, advertisers present

to the consumer on the conscious level a safe, neutral, naturally appealing

ad to pacify the consumer's resistance to subliminal advertising. While

glancing through an ad, the average consumer block-reads paragraphs and

barely notices an ad that they have seem many times. This is prime time

in subliminal reception because the conscious mind is uninterested in the

potentially offensive subliminal material. Key writes:



<P>To be effective, propaganda must constantly short circuit all thought

and decisions. It must operate on the individual at the level of the unconsciousness.

Critical judgment disappears altogether.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899948"></A>Perception</H2>

As defined earlier, perception is the brain's reception of incoming stimuli.

Some of this perception is conscious, while most of it is unconscious.

Key has said our primary sensory input is visual perception. There are

over 130 million receptor rods and cones packed in less than one square

inch of optic nerves in our retina. Key has said that the eyes do not edit

perception and the retina transmits everything to the brain's visual cortex

for processing. However, Meyers has claimed that "at the entry level, the

retina's neural layers encode and analyze the sensory information before

routing it to the cortex." Whichever the case, advertisers had done extensive

study on how our brains perceives input and has found that "most print

advertising is designed for perceptual exposure time of less than one second."

In other words, they are designed for the subconscious mind to absorb completely

instantaneously while the conscious mind barely catches the headline. Not

everyone perceives an image the same, however. Different perceptions would

ultimately affect each person's level of subliminal receptivity. For example,

"during a hypnotic trance, many subjects read quite fluently textual material

presented to them upside down and even in mirror image-an impossible task

for most people while awake." Key later concludes "it appears that individuals

trained in linear reasoning, cognitively or quantitatively oriented, have

higher [perception] thresholds and also appear more susceptible to substimuli."

Advertisers take advantage of the fact that our society and its individual

is sexually repressed in order to display sexually oriented subliminal

messages. This also partially explains why male genitalia is directed toward

males in advertisements, and female genitalia toward females. Men would

be more reserved in observing male genitalia while they would readily consciously

perceive embedded female breasts. After the image is discovered on the

Coke can (see Heaving Breasts), the viewer subsequently notices it every

time he or she sees the can. Further, the viewer is usually repulsed by

the image. This asserts Key's claim that "artists do not hide anything,

viewers do."

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899949"></A>Perceptual Defenses</H2>

The mechanism that blocks subliminal stimuli from our conscious awareness

is part of the brain's perceptual defense system. According to Key, this

defense mechanism operates automatically and invisibly. It is a double

edged sword. It prevents perceptual (sensory) overload, suppresses anxiety,

erases bad memories, prevents disturbing conscious memory associations,

and basically keeps you sane. Although it blocks these events from your

consciousness, it redirects them to your unconscious mind and these events

still influences your behavior. Key says the effects of perceptual defense

mechanisms at work include repression, isolation, regression, fantasy formation,

sublimation, denial, projection, and introjection. He writes, "To avoid

anxiety, overload, we construct perceptual defense mechanism to either

limit or distort our perception of reality." Repression seems to be the

central perceptual defense mechanism. R. D. Lang gives the definition of

repression is when "we forget something, then we forget we have forgotten."

Dixon writes, "[The] findings from the intensive study of perceptual defence

[sic]÷ put the validity of subliminal perception beyond any reasonable

doubt." Advertisers take advantage of our defense mechanisms to inject

subliminal messages into our subconscious mind. By using cultural taboos,

our defense mechanisms block sexually explicit images from our conscious

mind but our unconscious mind still perceives the image. We associate the

message with the product and when we see this product on the shelf at a

later date, are subconscious mind would follow the purchasing command and

consequently influencing our conscious mind to buy the product. In the

case of repression, the subliminal command hides away in unconscious memory

until an event, like the sight of the product on the shelf, triggers it.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899950"></A>Memory</H2>

Memory, the mental capacity or faculty of retaining or recalling facts,

events, impressions, or previous experiences, is one of the defining elements

in being human. Without it, we would be in perpetual infancy, and probably

would be living in a class lower than most mammals. However, we do possess

this ability to use as a tool and to be manipulated without our awareness.

Meyers defines memory recall as "the ability to retrieve information not

in conscious awareness." Retrieval cues, such as pneumonic devices, facilitate

the recall of information. Since we can perceive subliminal information,

we must also have the ability to subconsciously store this information

in memory. Like conscious perception to subconscious perception, conscious

memory is very limited, while subconscious memory has an enormous capacity

but lacks the ability to intellectually synthesize and interpret information.

The more emotionalized the data, for example sex and death, the more likely

it is to be retained in subconscious memory. Dr. Wilder Renfield, a Montreal

neurosurgeon, first empirically determined the existence of a subconscious

memory mechanism during a brain surgery more than 40 years ago. He also

theorized the brain retains every perception it receives. Poetzl supported

this theory by performing dream experiments and demonstrated that subliminal

messages could trigger conscious behavior from hours do months after exposure.

From a business standpoint, this could be very useful in influencing consumers

to buy their products. The sexually loaded subliminal message works its

way into the buyers' subconscious memory and days later when the buyer

goes into a store, the retrieval cues activate the command to influence

the buyer. This is why the most influential ads are the ones you don't

remember consciously. Key states:



<P>Ads that were recalled consciously was a loser. An advertisement is

to motivate a purchase decision-days, weeks, or even months after it has

been perceived for even an instant. The job of an ad is to sell-not to

be recalled.



<P>Knowing this, advertisers will employ every technique in the book to

tempt your drives and desires while provoking your fears.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899951"></A>Drives and Fears</H2>

We live in a complex society where our safety and well-being is mostly

protected. Most of us feel safe driving down to the local supermarket and

back, knowing that we will not be assaulted on the way and that our kids

and home is safe from harm. What if our society is taken away, or we are

taken away from society. If a group of us is dropped on a remote island,

it is likely that some of us will survive and procreate. Coded into our

genetic structure are instincts that will assure the continuation of mankind

if we are faced with such a situation. Drives such as thirst, hunger, and

sex, will propel us to take whatever actions necessary to survive. Meyers

has said, "Sexual motivation is nature's clever way of making people procreate,

thus enabling our specie's survival. The pleasure of sex is our genes'

way of preserving and spreading themselves." Fear of death, pain, and suffering

will warn us from dangerous situations. Since we live in a sheltered society,

our primal drives and fears have been altered to fit other forms. These

diametrical extremes-the beginning and the end, have been molded into desire

for attention, reassurance, acceptance, immortality, and the fear of financial

hardship, sexual insecurity, and loss of power. Few of us worry about when

our next meal is, and whether we will be living tomorrow. If we are ever

thirsty, we approach the nearest water fountain or the vending machine.

Despite the fact that our drives and fears are subdued and domesticated,

they still exist within us. Advertisers take advantage of this to tempt

our deepest drives and scare our morbid fears. Dixon has said that since

drives exist at such a fundamental level within us, it is prime target

for subliminal stimuli.



<P>In linking the more psychopathological aspects of subjective affective

states, with their relevance to drive schema, subliminal stimuli seem more

effective and supraliminal stimuli, presumably because they bypass the

"censoring" and restrictive role of consciousness.



<P>There are experiments supporting the greater influence of subliminal

stimuli on drives. Key says that "once primed by drive excitation, an individual

is more susceptible to substimuli." For example, Gorden and Spence, in

1966, has shown that hungry subjects are more subjective to subliminal

stimulation. To prime our sexual drives, advertisers will frequently embed

the word "SEX" into their ads .



<P>Although our drive for physical sustenance has been greatly alleviated,

our drive for sexual satisfaction is at its peak. Therefore, sex is the

common denominator for all advertisements. Carl Moog claims that "no other

type of psychological imagery hits people close to where they live." Remember,

we are in a sexually repressed society. Sex appeals to both the conscious

and subconscious mind by attracting attention and influencing their behavior

through drive control. Advertisers not only projects how their product

enhances the sexual experience, but simply gives permission to the public

for sexual promiscuity. Moog writes:



<P>Some of the most pervasive, sexual imagery in advertising is more symbolic

than blatant, although the connotations are far from subtle. The imagery

sends a message to the unconscious, granting permission to fulfill sexual

wishes and points the way to an attractor that can facilitate the encounter.

<H1>

<A NAME="_Toc389899952"></A>Advertiser's Arsenal</H1>

Armed with limitless resources, advertisers spend millions of dollars on

researching exactly how to make you buy their product. Knowing that you

have crave sex and fear death, Merit would want to know how their cigarettes

appeal to you. Schlitz Brewing Company spends 10 million dollars annually

to research how you drink beer. The consumer really doesn't know what they

want to buy in the mass market. Since mass production has taken over, the

difference in quality and effectiveness between one product and another

of a similar price is nonexistent. Some advertisers still boast the quality

of their products, but most have turned to more effective means of advertising-subliminal

advertising. In order to do this, they must do some background research.

After they find your vulnerabilities, they target specific these areas

and fire their shots of subliminal messages.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899953"></A>Motivational Research</H2>

Advertisers use motivational analysis or research (MR) to find the hidden

needs of the consumer. Old techniques such is polls did not provide the

depth and accuracy of knowledge advertisers required to create ads. This

research method gained momentum in the late 40's and early 50's. Louis

Cheskin, director of the Color Research Institute of America, and Ernest

Dichter, president of the Institute for Motivational Research, Inc., claim

to be the founding fathers of MR. Dichter says that the successful ad agency

"manipulates human motivations and desires and develops a need for goods

with which the public has at one time been unfamiliar-perhaps even undesirous

of purchasing." Psychology not only holds promise for understanding people

by "ultimately controlling their behavior." One of the research techniques

advertisers used is depth interviews, either in individuals or groups.

The researcher would gather a group of people and discuss a topic, like

in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. The psychologist would lead and direct

the discussion so people would reveal their fears and desires. For example,

an alcoholic might say something about having nightmares after trying to

stop drinking. The researcher would then ask exactly what the alcoholic

was dreaming about, and then use his dreams as subliminal images on advertisements.

Devious indeed. Another method researchers use is the Rorschach Ink-blot

test, developed by Hermann Rorschach. The subjects are asked to stare into

formless ink blots and describe what they see. Supposedly, the subjects

will reveal their hidden needs by seeing what they want to see. Some more

commonly used techniques are Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), hypnosis,

cartoon bubble filling, and Szondi test. The TAT is similar to the ink

blot test, except real images and potential advertisements are used. Researchers

might hypnotize a subject and ask him to tell secrets he would never openly

reveal. In the cartoon test, the subject is shown an emotional cartoon

with the dialogue bubbles blank, and the subject is asked to fill it in.

Finally, the in Szondi test, researchers begin with the assumption that

everyone is a little crazy. They show their subjects pictures of people

and ask them who they would most likely to sit next to and least likely

to sit next to. Each picture, however, shows someone who has a psychiatric

disorder: paranoid, depressed, etc. In all of these tests, the subject

is asked to project himself. After the advertisers find what appeals most

to the consumer, they send the ideas to their graphic design artists to

include it subliminal in their ads.

<H2>

<A NAME="_Toc389899954"></A>Subliminal Strategies</H2>

Graphic design artists have a wealth of tools at their hands to expertly

embed subliminal messages into their pictures. At the dawn of subliminal

advertising, graphic artists painted on photographs. That was very difficult

to do without ruining the picture. Later, with bigger budgets and better

equipment, graphic artists used airbrushes to craft their design onto billboards

and then take a picture of it. Now, everything is done digitally on the

computer with perfection. Key has said there are six general subliminal

strategies: figure-ground reversals, embedding, double entendre, low-intensity

light and low-volume sound, tachistoscopic displays, lighting and background

sound. Graphic artists can take advantage of multiple techniques to produce

the desired effects.



<P>To protect the brain from sensory overload, our perceptual defense mechanism

distinguishes every perception into figure (foreground, subject) and ground

(background, environment). We consciously notice the figure, while the

ground floats around it unless something there brings it to the foreground.

Perceptual psychologist Dr. E. Rubin created his famous Rubin's Profiles

that can be found in almost every psychology text book today. His profiles,

the faces and vases, old women and young women, duck and rabbit, are syncretistic

(two sided) illusions. Noticing one set of features, you see one thing,

while noticing another set of features, you see something else. Advertisers

take advantage of this to paint subliminal messages into the picture's

background. They are usually cultural taboos, making it even harder for

the audience to perceive it.



<P><FONT color=blue>Microsoft uses syncretistic illusions in the Windows 95 startup splash

screen</FONT>. It's the perfect place to put subliminal messages-most of us ignore

it. Furthermore, if we ever stared into it, we are constantly distracted

by the scrolling bar on the bottom of the screen. The intended audience

are network administrators, corporate advisors, and home users in the power

of buying this software-middle age men in their late forties. The slogan

for Windows 95 is "Where do you want to go today?" It implies freedom,

power, and control. Taken all this into account, you will find a hippie

rocker (Woodstock), black stallion, and an eagle painted in the sky. The

most prominent image is of course sex, displayed as the classic male dominant

side profile of him kissing the female below. No wonder Windows 95 is so

popular among zombies.



<P>Embedding is the processing of hiding one image in the form of another.

This is a difficulty process but if successful, very influential. Key writes,

"Embeds enhance perceptual experience of the picture÷ Emotionalized, repressed

information remains in the memory system for long periods, perhaps for

a lifetime." Genitalia is one of the most often used images for embedding.

The female torso in the Diet Coke can described earlier is an example of

embedding. For alcohol or soft drink ads, advertisers like to depict their

drink in either the bottle or a glass, half filled ice cubes and half with

the drink, with condensation drops oozing down the sides of the glass.

Graphic artists has gotten a lot of expertise at embedding objects in these

pictures. The advertisers' favorite image to put in here are skulls and

screaming contorted faces. Key has analyzed such an ad and found that these

are the nightmares alcoholics have in their sleep. Using a similar technique,

I also found a dozen or so screaming faces, skulls, and animal faces in

a Seagram's Extra Dry Gin ad. If I only found one face in one ad, it could

have come from my imagination. The multitude of similar images in several

alcohol ads shows that advertisers must have intentionally put it in.



<P>Many images, phrases, and slogans have hidden double meanings behind

them. This is called double entendre. Symbolism can also go into this category.

Often, their hidden meanings have sexual connotations. For example Microsoft's

"Where do you want to go today?" and American Express' "Do more," when

taken out of context, could have sexual implications. Key writes:



<P>Double meanings appear to enrich significance in virtually any symbolic

stimuli. Unconsciously perceived information of this taboo nature ensures

a deep, meaningful emotional response, and continued memory.



<P>Another example of advertiser's exploitation of double entendre is Crown

Royal's holiday whiskey ad. The whiskey bottle is completely wrapped in

a purple bag, with a card that says "To: Dad" on it. At the bottom of the

page, big bold letters say "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag." Below this in

smaller letters there is the phrase, "Those who appreciate quality enjoy

it responsibly." The double meaning behind this ad is the call for Dad

to have sex. During the holidays, Dad will open the bag (condom) uncovering

his masculinity and consequently enjoys sex even more.



<P>There is a plethora of other symbolic imagery that advertisers take

advantage of. Advertisers often use lemon and oranges to portray fertility

and women. Ties are a common phallic symbol. Through these symbolic images,

can present a seemingly harmless ad while entrenching your subconscious

mind with deeper meanings. Moog writes about symbolic imagery:



<P>Symbolic communications bypass the layers of logic and cultural appropriateness

and head straight for the unconscious, which is then free to find an equivalence

between what is symbolized, in this case sexual arousal÷



<P>Another technique advertisers is low-intensity light and its auditory

equivalent low-volume sound. Graphic artists paint faint subliminal images

below the conscious threshold of perception but above the unconscious perception

threshold. By far the most commonly embedded image is the word SEX. Key

have said that "advertisers have indiscriminately sexualized virtually

everything they publish or broadcast with subliminal SEXes." Often, graphic

artists mosaic SEXes onto textured surfaces or in edges, shadows, and highlights.

Just pick up any major magazine, relax, and stare into it for a couple

of minutes. You will soon find these SEXes popping out at you. Other commonly

used words are FUCK, DIE, and KILL, among other emotionally loaded four

letter words. Such subliminal instructions are dangerous indeed. Dixon

writes, "It may be impossible to resist instructions which are not consciously

experienced."



<P>The final two techniques, tachistoscopic display and lighting and background

sound, are used in film and video advertisers. As mentioned earlier, tachistoscopic

displays flash images onto the screen in fractions of a second not perceivable

by the conscious mind. Another method tachistoscopic displays can use is

superimposing the image onto existing image just below the conscious perception

level, as Dr. Becker has done. Lighting and background sound adjust the

mood of the scenery. In most cases, it reinforces the conscious perception.



<P>Using these research and subliminal techniques, advertisers have great

control on the consumer. With motivational research, they have found eight

hidden needs in the human psyche: emotional security, reassurance of worth,

ego-gratification, creative outlets, love objects, sense of power, sense

of roots, and immortality. Also, advertisers found ten areas of behavior

they can subliminal influence: conscious perception, emotional response,

drive-related behaviors, adaptation levels, verbal formulations, memory,

perceptual defenses, dreams, psychopathology, and purchasing and consumption

behavior. Anyone has the potential to influence all ten behaviors, but

advertisers of course are concerned with purchasing and consumption behaviors.

With their billion dollar budgets, advertisers can use this knowledge to

break down any consumer barriers.

<H1>

<A NAME="_Toc389899955"></A>Legal Issues</H1>

It is obvious that by tapping into the consumer's unconscious mind without

their knowledge, the advertisers are engaging in deceptive practices. It

is also an invasion of privacy. But, is this legal? The answer is no. There

are numerous legislation that prohibit advertisers from using subliminal

messages in their ads. The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) Act Sec 5 - "prohibits

unfair or deceptive acts or practices in interstate commerce." They also

claim they "have primary responsibility for regulation of advertising in

this country." However, Key writes that "there appears to be nothing here

that would provoke the FTC into a charge of deceptive advertising." The

TV Code of the National Association of Broadcasters (IV, 14) states: "Any

technique whereby an attempt is made to convey information to the viewer

by transmitting messages below the threshold of normal awareness is not

permitted." Unfortunately, these laws are vaguely stated yet greatly limited.

The most potentially effective regulation is made by the U.S. Treasury

Department, Division of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). It states:



<P>Subliminals are inherently deceptive because the consumer does not perceive

them at a normal level of awareness, and thus is given no choice whether

to accept or reject the message, as is the case with normal advertising.

ATF holds that this type of advertising technique is false and deceptive,

and is prohibited by law.



<P>The problem in this legal fight is not legislation, unfortunately. It

is the proof. Because of its nature, subliminal messages are nearly impossible

to prove. How do you prove to the judge there is a naked women in the Diet

Coke can? How do you prove to the jury there are screaming faces hidden

ice cubes? In this legal system, you can't. The evidence would be considered

circumstantial. Advertisers would of course deny any such activity and

claim that if you stare into anything long enough, you will find it. The

most substantial evidence is they spending billions annually on research

and subliminal advertising. Therefore, it must work?!? Another crutch against

us is that no one, including the advertisers, know how the brain works.

They just know that it does. Until we can scientifically prove subliminal

perception, this quest may be in vain. Key writes: "The rules prohibiting

repressed media content have been ignored. None of the regulations have

ever been enforced." It seems like we are on losing grounds in this legal

battle.

<H1>

<A NAME="_Toc389899956"></A>Conclusions</H1>

Advertisers have taken a firm hold on our daily lives. Half of their dominating

influence can be attributed to their use of subliminal advertising. They

take advantage of the vulnerabilities in our subconscious minds. Using

the latest computer technology, they have unparalleled resources to manipulate

each image to target a specific weakness in us. Key claims that "subliminal

indoctrination may prove more dangerous than nuclear weapons. [Our] present

odds appear to favor total devastation." Also, he writes that "once the

group or collective unconscious is programmed into what has been called

culture, virtually any bill of good scan be sold at conscious levels."

Although the first statement is rather bleak and melodramatic, his second

point is a good one. Congressmen or private companies can use subliminal

messages on TV shows to sway votes one way or the other. The military can

muffle outcries against war. The potential for control of the American

people is enormous. What can you do to protect yourself? Knowledge. Knowledge

that advertisers are trying to influence and control you, and that you

can fight back. The next time you make a purchasing decision, ask yourself,

"Why am I choosing this product?" Buy a product because of its taste, its

quality, and its price. Never buy a product because its packaging looks

good or because it is a name brand. Remember, it is the major companies

that have the resources to do subliminal advertising. Also, harass your

congressmen to make and enforce laws against subliminal broadcasting and

printing. Write letters of complaint and gather signatures to send to the

advertiser. Eventually, it will work. Despite all this, it really is entertaining

trying to see through the advertisements and find subliminal messages in

them. It's kind of like beating them at their own game. The next time you

go out for dinner, stare into the restaurant's placements or a luscious

steamy dinner on the menu. See what you can find.
