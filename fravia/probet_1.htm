Good protection schemes should be written in assembler. Applications should be

written in a high level language. These two statements are incompatible if you

truly wish to incorporate protection throughout your application. I have however

developed a technique that allows protection to be added to a C or C++ program

<b>after the program has been compiled and linked</b>. This has the 

advantage that the inserted code can be generated by another program and can

thus be different for every program or version of a program that you issue.

Fravia+ and others have stated that to be a good protectionist you first need to

be a good cracker. I admit I started out as a protectionist, and with hind-sight

I was not a particularly good one. I then learned and used the crackers techniques, 

most from Fravia+s wonderful web site. (Thanks Fravia+). These lessons in cracking

gave me some wonderful insights into how I might in turn protect my own programs

from crackers. I now want to give something back to the community, hence this

article.

<font size =+2><b>Introduction</b></font><p>



I don't want to get into the argument between the use of high level languages

and assembler. I agree that assembler language can be much more efficient than

a high level language both in speed of operation and in memory footprint. However

I feel that a high level language (such as C or C++) is generally the only tool

of choice for many applications. Unfortunately any protection scheme that is

written in a high level language is significantly weaker than one in assembler.<p>



I would like to demonstrate a technique that allows assembler code to be added to

an executable after it has been compiled and linked.<p>



To demonstrate the technique I will implement two of Mark's famous 14 protectors

commandments.<p>



6. Patch your own software. Change your code to call different validation

routines each time.<br>



B. Flood the cracker with bogus calls and hard coded strings.<p>



I have techniques that implement many more of the commandments and I will describe

them in later articles which will build on the techniques described here.<p>



<font size =+2><b>Patch your own software</b></font><p>



My technique is probably not quite what Mark had in mind. I assume Mark meant

that each time the application was <i>run</i> it would modify its own file copy.

The idea I have in mind however is that every <i>release</i> of a program will

be different. Many releases of a product are just bug-fixes or minor changes to

the program. The comparison of two releases will show that they are substantially

the same with only a small percentage change. Thus if one version has been 

cracked then cracking later versions is very easy.<p>



To patch an executable we need to know two things.<p>

1. Where the patch is to be applied<br>

2. What goes into the patch<p>



<font size =+1><b>Where the patch is to be applied</b></font><p>



We can determine where to apply a patch by putting a <i>signature</i> in the

program which can be recognised by the patch program. This signature should be

one that would not normally appear in the output of the compiler/linker. For

patches to the code segment I define the following macro.



<pre>

#define PATCH10 \

	__asm { _emit 0x72}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x01}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x72}; \

	__asm { _emit 0xf9}; \

	__asm { _emit 0xe9}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x01}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x00}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x00}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x00}; \

	__asm { nop };\

</pre>



The code generated by this macro has the advantage that it could never be

generated normally by a compiler. It is also code that cannot be correctly

handled by any dis-assembler (including IDA), but more on this later.<p>



The best dis-assembly of this code is:-



<pre>

	72 01            jp +1

	72 f9            jp -7

	e9 01 00 00 00   jmp +1

	90               nop

</pre>



The reason this cannot be generated normally is clear in the first jp instruction.

It is actually jumping to the middle of the second instruction, specifically to

the byte f9. This op-code is the assembler instruction 'stc'. It is clear that

this sequence would not normally be generated by any compiler!<p>



This pattern of 10 bytes can be searched for by the patch program and replaced

by alternative assembler code of length 10 bytes. Of course the macro can be

modified to produce different lengths of 'holes' in the executable. For example.<p>



<pre>

#define PATCH20 \

	__asm { _emit 0x72}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x01}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x72}; \

	__asm { _emit 0xf9}; \

	__asm { _emit 0xe9}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x0b}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x00}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x00}; \

	__asm { _emit 0x00}; \

	__asm { nop };\

	__asm { nop };\

	__asm { nop };\

	__asm { nop };\

	__asm { nop };\

	__asm { nop };\

	__asm { nop };\

	__asm { nop };\

	__asm { nop };\

	__asm { nop };\

	__asm { nop };\

</pre>



This produces a 'hole' of 20 bytes. The same principle can be extended to 

provide holes of any size. I use holes of upto 100000 bytes in my programs.<p>



To use these macros is very easy. The following source code shows the principle<p>



<pre>

void	main(void) {                    PATCH10

    printf("Hello world\n");            PATCH20

    exit(1);                            PATCH10

}

</pre>



This code will result in 'holes' of 10 or 20 bytes between each line of compiler

generated code. The next question is what do we want to put in these 'holes'.<p>



<font size =+1><b>What can be patched in</b></font><p>



Now 10 or 20 bytes may not seem much. Consider however that a compiler will

generate only 20 or 30 bytes of code on average for each line of source code

(this varies from only four or five bytes upto 100 or so). Percentage wise this

can easily add up to a substantial fraction of our code and has the advantage

that is is dispersed throughout our code.<p>



I admit that we can't do much functional code in 10 or 20 bytes. We can however

(finally) get to Mark's Commandment B. Flood the cracker with bogus code and

hard coded strings.<p>



<font size =+2><b>Flood the cracker with bogus code.</b></font><p>



The Microsnot C++ compilers can produce either optimised or non-optimised code.

I noted that in the non-optimised code every line of source code is self

contained and registers EAX, EBX, ECX and EDX are not used to carry values

between the code generated for different source code line. In optimised mode

however these registers can be used to hold local variables.<p>



To insert assembler between lines of C source code I compile my program with

optimisation turned off. I can then generate bogus code using the following

types of instructions.<p>



<pre>

mov toReg, frReg

mov toReg, [ebp+xx]

inc/dec toReg

mov toReg XXXXXXXX

mov toReg dword_xxxxxxxx

cmp toReg dword_xxxxxxxx

</pre>



Where <i>toReg</i> is one of EAX,EBC,ECX,EDX and <i>frReg</i> is one of

EAX,ECX,EDX,EBX,ESP,EBP,ESI or EDI. The dword_xxxxxxxx is a random address in

the data segment. This one is especially useful since it results in many bogus

references being produced by IDA. One of the powers of IDA is being able to

easily identify any reference to a data value. With hundreds (or thousands) of

bogus references this makes the crackers work so much harder.<p>



This list of bogus code instructions can easily be extended. The trick is to

look at the output of the compiler (using IDA) and see what typical instructions

it generates. We don't want to generate code that will affect the program

execution so the following instructions would not be allowed<p>



<pre>

mov frReg, toReg

mov dword_xxxxxxxx, toReg

push toReg

</pre>



The source code to generate this code is simply a large switch statement, one

case for each type of generated code. The selection is made on an random basis

and the choice of registers for each case is also chosen at random. The switch

statement is enclosed in a loop which adds data into a 'hole' until the hole is

filled with random garbage. Take care however to include a few one byte op-codes

so that the holes can be filled completely (e.g. stc, clc).<p>



<font size =+1><b>Confusing IDA and SoftIce</b></font><p>



I would also like to demonstrate some techniques that will confuse IDA and

SoftIce disassembly. Remember the code generated by the PATCH macros? The

code had two execution routes, in one route a byte could be used as the first

byte of an op-code in another route it could be used as a data byte to an op-code.

IDA is unable to cope with this since it can't show the same byte being used in

two different assembler instructions.<p>



This technique can be used to hide functional code. Take for example the

following code



<pre>



430502  81 C7 33 C0 F7 F0  add edi, 0F0F7C033h

430508  0F 82 F6 FF FF FF  jb loc_430502+2



</pre>

At first glance this looks fairly innocuous. But note that the conditional jump

is to a location in the middle of a multi-byte op-code. If we dis-assemble from

address 430504 we get the following code.



<pre>



430504  33 C0              xor eax,eax

430506  F7 F0              div eax

430508  0F 82 F6 FF FF FF  jb loc_430504



</PRE>

Now this is certainly <b>not</b> innocuous. It will generate a divide by zero

exception and this was hidden from view in the original IDA output.<p>



Now it is certainly more difficult to write code in this way but for certain

key routines (like tests for the presence of SoftIce) it can be an invaluable

technique. Personally I have combined this technique with the technique of 

patching code into holes to put multiple checks for SoftIce into my own code.

Each SoftIce check was generated using random registers and random code sections

so that each SoftIce check is different. Having found one such routine the cracker

can not then use a simple byte search to find the other routines.<p>
