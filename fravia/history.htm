'Now reader,' said fravia+, 'look upon the programming reality! Breathe 

the free air again!'

From the porch upon the top of the high site they could see beyond 

the stream the green fields of assembly fading into distant grey.

Curtains of wind-blown rain were slanting down. The sky above and to the west 

was still dark with thunder, and lightning far away flicklered among the tops of 

hidden hills. But the wind had shifted to the north, and already the storm that 

had come out of the East was receding, rolling away southward to the sea. Suddendly through a rent 

in the clouds behind them a shaft of sun stabbed down. the falling showers gleamed like silver, 

and far away the river glittered like a shimmering glass.<br>

'It is not so dark here,' said the reader.<br>

'No,' said fravia+. 'Nor does the windows OS lie so heavily on your shoulders as some 

would have you think. Cast aside your &quot;visual&quot; frills!'<br>

From the reader's hand the heavy M$-books fell clattering on the stones. He drew himself up, 

slowly, as a man that is stiff from long bending over some dull toil. Now tall and straight he 

stood, and his eyes were blue as he looked into the opening sky.<br>

'Dark have been my dreams of late,' he said, 'but I feel as one new-awakened. I would now 

that you had come before, fravia+. For I fear that already you have come too late, only to 

see the last days of real programming. Not long now shall stand the high hall which the 

great assembly wizards of the past built. OOP shall devour the high sites. What is to be done?'<br>

'Much,' said fravia+...

<font size="+3"><b>Why I publish</b></font><br>

I decided to publish my &quot;page of reverse engineering&quot; because the inner working 

of computer programs (and any other thing) has always fascinated me. 

<br>Software programs (software 

operating systems too, for that matter) are being more and more &quot;hidden&quot; from 

the user (as the growing appearance of &quot;Wizards&quot; and automated installation and 

de-installation procedures attest) and are more and more using &quot;undocumented&quot; 

functions and performing &quot;clandestine&quot; activities on user machines.<br>Such 

&quot;covert&quot; activities encompass among other things:<br>

- the unashamed spying of the installed software (eventually denouncing it 

(secretly) in the background during a web connection): Many recent Micro$oft 

products.<br> 

- the gathering (secretly) of information about the user and his choices and 

preferences delivering it to commercial oriented bastards for spamming ads or 

unsolicited email (web-scripts, 

web-search engines and some commercial software)<br>

- the modification (without asking of course) of many user-parameters of the operating 

system, the deletion or modification or &quot;updating&quot; of user files, the fiddling with 

the physical locations of the user harddisk and so on (many protection schemes and many 

installation procedures).<br><br>

It has always astonished me that so few even cared to check such 

developments, and that virtually nobody fought against them or tried to counter (or retaliate). 

I conduced a very 

lonely fight on my own, which started long ago on a Sinclair spectrum and will 

probably never finish :-(<br><br>

There is another reason for my activity: The Web, as 

you will already have realized, is an Ocean of knowledge... about two centimeters deep. 

I wanted 

to show that you can create a non-commercial site that spreads for free REAL knowledge, 

and I believe that I made my point. There is <a href="kent_com.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/kent_com.htm">not a single ad</a> on my site, and I'm loosing 

money with all this, not making it. Yet at the time of writing there are more than 30000 hits 

<u>every day</u> on my pages... which gives a spreading of much more than 100000 <u>new</u> readers 

every month. More than enough.

<br>

<a name="anchororc"><hr>

<font size="+3"><b>+ORC</b></font><br>

As soon as I saw the first 

lessons by +ORC, 

back in the winter of 1995, I understood that a new dawn was possible (at least among   

crackers :-) if enough of us   

would have understood and carried his tutorial and his simple (but incredibly deep) message: 

&quot;knowledge is now free at last, everything 

should be free from now on, enjoy knowledge and life and work for everybody else&quot;. I was 

also struck from the affinities between my own ideas and +ORC's philosophy.<br><br>

+ORC's approach, in choosing &quot;cracking&quot; (the busting of software protections) as channel 

through which his ideas could be at least partly diffused was 

simply genial: There you had on one side a huge community of very clever and talented 

young people, with an incredible thirst for knowledge, which could NEVER be satisfied by 

a society mainly intent in transforming them in silly consumer guinea pigs and there you 

had on the other side our Web, growing with an incredible momentum: the perfect media 

for free &quot;forbidden&quot; knowledge spreading. An high explosive cocktail indeed!<br><br>

The developments of the last  

years with the incredible 

growth of the &quot;+ORC's students&quot; section, confirms that +ORC has indeed 

thrown a lot of seeds in the wind! :-)<br><br>

His tutorial is now (May 1999) in part obsolete (yet it remains a MUST reading for 

all people that learn reversing skills). The incredibly rash 

development of the 

+HCU has given results that went beyond any possible forecast. The +HCU is certainly 

not &quot;a group of crackers like many other&quot;. In fact it 

is a loose association of more than one hundred reverse engineers, protectors, cryptographical wizards 

and crackers (lone wolfs or in one of the many existing groups). 

The +HCU  publishes each year (in April) a &quot;strainer&quot; for admission to 

the subsequent year courses (<a href="straine1.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/straine1.htm">this year's strainer</a> is still 'in the making', though.<br>The +HCU is nowadays, through 

his many <a href="student.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/student.htm">projects</a> and the more than 400 <a href="academy/index.html" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/academy/index.html">essays</a>, 

a real free &quot;Academy&quot; of software reverse engineering (the 

&quot;open university&quot; of software reverse engineering) 

whose documents are eagerly awaited (and read) by many &quot;professional&quot; 

reverse engineer around the world. Judging from the postings I have received there 

is more and more &quot;official&quot; recognition of our work, an activity that a 

couple of years ago could still be dismissed as simple protection cracking.<br><br>+ORC has 

partly retired. He's apparently gone hyeroglyphologist and dwells at the 

moment in Egypt somewhere, cracking ancient legends. On 

29 October 1997 he wrote a 

<a href="newuni.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/newuni.htm">letter</a> about the organization of the +HCU 

and in december charged +Alistair and +Aesculapius to take over this year courses (and 

the preparation of this year <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/THCU99.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/THCU99.htm'" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/THCU99.htm">strainer</a> for 1999) with a vague 

promise to 'take over' the HCU teaching in September 1998... but he never did :-( I would really like to 

get at least his two promised 'zen cracking' lessons :-)

<br><a name="anchorkno"><hr>

<font size="+3"><b>KNOWLEDGE IS NOW FREE</b></font><br>Anyway even the +HCU is in 

my opinion not very important <i>per se</i>. What IS important is the fact that all over the 

web many (and I mean it: <u>MANY</u>, not few) are learning (and putting in practice) the same principles: &quot;knowledge is now 


free at last&quot;... since we are dealing mainly with software here, and since sofware HAS 

a huge importance today, the fact that the average &quot;Joe User&quot; is slowly understanding 

that he can CONTROL and MODIFY whatever he fancies  

 has already a HUGE impact on the silly commercial bastards that 

would like to continue to make money out of people kept in ignorance. If you are 

reading these words of mine buried under the overbloated weight of  

M$IE 4 or Netscape's 'Communicator' you'll be pleasantly surprised as soon as you 

download 

and try the 

last version of <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.operasoftware.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.operasoftware.com/'" tppabs="http://www.operasoftware.com/">Opera</a>, a small (yet incredibly effective) browser by an australian 


genius which lets the huge overbloated 'standard' dinobrowsers by Micro$oft and Netscape 

byte dust.<br>This said, the <i>non plus ultra</i> of all 

web-browsing experiences 

remains imho surfing with your own <u>modified</u> copy of Netscape 3 (the best version 

of Navigator so far). We have done it 'manually' a long time ago, reversing the hell out 

of it, but now you'll be able to 

'panzer' and 'fortify' as you wish every aspect of this target very easily, since 

 Netscape, in utter desperation against Micro$oft vicious attacks, has been compelled 

to given out publicily its 

source code... which is good: you should receive (or get nevertheless :-) the source code of 

every app you use, that would spare you a lot of problems...<br>Browsers are not the only 

evidence of the fact that &quot;the storm is receding&quot;: as anyone that has done 'the great 

step' knows, noone in his right 

mind would ever think to go back to the puke called windows after having used Linux (else 

than for cracking its sofware, that is :-)<br><a name="anchorbey"><hr>

<font size="+3"><b>Beyond software reverse engineering</b></font><br>

Reverse engineering software, as I write elsewhere, is more an &quot;attitude&quot; 

than a simple collection of techniques. It has much to do with a logical, 

puzzle-solving, approach, 

and requires knowledge, luck and &quot;feeling&quot;. We have until now cracked mostly 

protection 

schemes (and we will occasionally continue to do so), because this allowed 

to accommodate many talented young people on the bandwagon, 

(there is an obvious &quot;immediate&quot; reward if you crack a protection scheme and, as everyone knows: 

&quot;<font color="blue">Copy-protection schemes</font>&quot; are nothing else than elegant devices for training the next generation of

assembly-language programmers :-), but 

as you'll be able to see, watching the evolution of the essays hosted on my site, a 

growing number of &quot;crackers&quot; is already walking along 

much more interesting paths, and goes already now to incredible 

lengths in order to reverse 

engineer a &quot;difficult&quot; snippet of code, not necessarily belonging to a protection.<br>

On the other hand, more and more essays try to 'improve' the protection schemes used in 

the targeted software. A development that many 'lesser' crackers have heavily 

criticized on usenet, their pathetical idea being that we should keep among  

us the knowledge... Why? In order to crack undisturbed the 

same old boring protections for the eternity?<br>NO! Life <u>is</u> development, and if a 

software 

programmer will trough our essays learn enough to protect his software so well 

that we will 

not be able to bust his schemes, that's a very GOOD development. 

At least a real challenge!

<br><br>

Software reverse engineering is anyway only a part of the more complex task of defending  

yourself against manipulations and actions that you are not even supposed to see or 

understand. You'll quickly understand what this means if you have a look at my relevant 

pages, like the one on <a href="noanon.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/noanon.htm">anonymity</a>, or the one (that I love) on 

<a href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm">reality cracking</a>. In fact I believe 

that the &quot;reality cracking&quot; section will acquire a more and more important 

role in the future years, and not only (I hope) on my site. The point, you see, is that 

cracking, far from being a shady semi-legal activity, is one of the MOST IMPORTANT 

professions of the world. A cracker (in this broad sense) is 

a teacher and a philosoph, an acute observer, a 

talented wise wizard in our oligarchic, democracy-faking world where hidden 

meanings and continuous manipulation are the 

norm. Crackers should teach your sons what really happens in a <a href="slaves.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/slaves.htm">supermarket</a>, 


why there are so many <a href="ath_sta1.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ath_sta1.htm">lotteries</a>, why you are compelled to 

drink <a href="modernze.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/modernze.htm">mineral water</a> and what they are doing to your mind every 

time you watch some apparently innocent <a href="marlbo2.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/marlbo2.htm">publicity ad</a>. And by all 

means crackers 


should teach your sons <a href="howtosea.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howtosea.htm">how to search</a> the web, how to 


<a href="noanon.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/noanon.htm">avoid leaving tracks</a> and, last but not least where 


to find (some snippets of) <a href="realicra.htm#anchorinfo" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm#anchorinfo">real information</a> about 


this ugly society that surrounds us.


<br><a name="anchorcen"><hr>


<font size="+3"><b>Censorship attempts</b></font><br>


My pages have always spread knowledge for free and have been 


 therefore heavily censored. They have been first censored by 


Compu$erve (&amp; Micro$oft) on 21/08/1996.<br> 


My following main page, at http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5513,


(one of the &quot;top 1000&quot; pages according to Webcounter's stat) had not much more luck... 


it was censored as well -by Geocities- after 18 months, on 16 April 1997.<br>I immediately 


set up two mirror pages, 


a new one at geocities and another one at mygale,


 hoping, optimistically, that the European 


free pages providers would have been far less bigots and commercially oriented 


than the American ones. Alas 


this was not 


the case, 


and the &quot;mygaliens&quot; have censored my site on 23 May 1997 as well, as soon as it had 


mounted among their 


&quot;top ten&quot; pages (which was very quick, since the &quot;audience&quot; of my site doubles every two 


months :-). Geocities censured my new site <u>as well</u> <font color="blue">the same 


day</font>, probably in the hope 


to &quot;squeeze&quot; me out 


of the web with a 'coordinated' censorship manoeuver... poor sod censors, they still do 


not seem to understand the &quot;alfa and omega&quot; of 


Internet!<br>From that moment I decided anyway to seek asylum  


among more solid providers, and I continue to thank 


<font color="purple">Mailman</font> and mighty <font color="purple">Sharp</font> for 


having hosted for a long time my &quot;fortress&quot;


page at <img SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://207.30.50.126/fravia/fravia.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://207.30.50.126/fravia/fravia.htm'" tppabs="http://207.30.50.126/fravia/fravia.htm">http://207.30.50.126/fravia/fravia.htm</a> (the &quot;tana&quot;)<br><br>


Unfortunately even this relatively solid server began being attacked for some of 


my pages (the ones about CGI-script security, i.e. how to nuke a site you don't like, 


on the web, given some conditions). In fact many servers are OWNED by people running 


scam commercial smut sites, and they can allow any abominable smut site BUT NOT a site 


that teaches you how to nuke them.<br>In November 1997 the situation in my old main page (which still work well thanks Sharp) 


was deteriorating. The hosting server decided to 


put a 'default' page catcher for its smut search engines that snapped every time 


anyone on 


the server (even people not remotely connected with those sites) found a broken 


link. An abomination 


against which Sharp could not do much, which has forced me to crash open 


my fortress at http://fravia.org on the 25th of November 1997, a month before its 


scheduled openings (you should ALWAYS keep a complete 'sleeping' site up your 


arms just in case, btw :-)<br>Short afterward Sharp's part of the server was destroyed 


by the bigot 


american SPA association (note that they smashed only 'intelligent' cracker pages 


and didn't touch the 


warez sites on the same server... well, no wonder, they are the same lackeys 


that condoned the 


blatant piracy of Micro$oft in the Stacker software case...)<br>For 


all these reasons I'm now very happy 


to have a new 


powerful FORTRESS thank to a gracious donation, and without any  


ugly sponsoring. I must say that the people at Webcaf» are doing a 


really GREAT job so if anyone should ever come to the thought of sending 


me money: I don't need money: send it to Netcaf» instead :-) Anyway I hope that 


this relative 'tranquility' from censorship will allow me to deliver a


less chaotic <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.fravia.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.fravia.org/'" tppabs="http://www.fravia.org/">fravia's page of reverse engineering</a> to my readers :-)<br>


<br>





<br>This continued censorship (&quot;pagewaxing&quot;) should not 


surprise you: there's a growing hostility, on the web, against knowledge that's given 


away for free: they would like a commercial, mercantile world of stupid publicity ads 


and irrelevant frills, where the slaves and guinea pigs of their useless advertisements 


live and work only in 


order to consume... that's the real 


reason they despise and hate anything that moves in the opposite direction... but we'll win, 


because that what we do, we do for pleasure, not for money :-)<br>  


I'm proud of the censorship attempts I had to endure: Geocities is an American &quot;puritane&quot; 


enterprise, 


which 


seems to have more or less the same civic courage as an eggplant; Mygale is (was?) the 


pathetic attempt of 


a young student in Paris to get himself a job and to &quot;establish a French presence on 


the Web&quot;, as 


if nationality or language would 


still matter in our new world; Compu$erve is a doomed dinosaur of 


the pre-Internet age, and commercial smut site owners should IMHO be hanged at 


their own servers' towers using their mouse's cable.<br>Most 'space providers' have ONE 


common characteristic: they want to make money, and they want to make money in 


the only way they know of: through awful publicity ads, selling gadgets that nobody 


in his right mind would ever consider to buy 


and offering -for money- special &quot;services&quot; that in most cases you could 


get for free elsewhere... a typical pathetical case, on the web, being the services that 


'register' you (for payment) on the 'major' search engines. Ah!<br>


Moreover in order to gain money these lusers believe (wrongly) that they should &quot;conform&quot; 


to the low-profile trend of self-censorship that pervades our supine society.<br>


<a name="anchordes">


<hr>


<font size="+3"><b>Censors deserve only contempt,<br>on the net and elsewhere.</b></font><br>


<br>


Yes, I have started a <a href="ideale.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ideale.htm">fight</a> against all commercial-smut depots (against 


all ugly commercial oriented trends on the web for that matter). I'm not a censor, 


and I have 


nothing at all against nude pictures (if given away for free) but there are some Web 


trends that I feel we must counter (and retaliate).<br>One of this is the proliferating 


of the awful commercial smut depots, that deliver (against payment) poor scanned images that 


anybody frustrated enough to need them could have -for free- on the relevant usenet groups.<br>This is not 


only a fraud, but is pestering more and more servers, among others my own old one. Things 


are so bad that commercial smut owners impose  'smut-default-catchers' on the servers 


where they dwell, i.e. a smut 


page that you automatically get every time you run a broken link on ANY site of the whole 


server. Other common tricks are the opening of one or more new (smaller) pages every 


time somebody visits a 


site. Unknowingly to the user, these pages trigger bogus hits on banners 


that the visitor would never have dreamed of clicking. There are many more 


(pathetically shoddy) tricks of the commercial site owners... you may 


want to learn how to rebuke them on my <a href="javascri.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/javascri.htm">javascript tricks</a> page, or you 


may enjoy directly destroying (or damaging) those sites through the tricks 


described on my <a href="ideale.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ideale.htm">Antismut CGI-reversing</a> pages, which 


will be available with the rest of my site as long as the servers 


where I'm hosted will be able to defend me.


<br>


This said, I could 


not care less about any future censorship attempt... as soon as they censor 


me, I'll open a 


new site (or even a couple of mirrors) 


somewhere else... the 


exponential growth of the Net is on my side and against all censorship attempts <br>


<br>Censorship on the web hydes its face (geocities: 'no links to craacking tools are allowed'), yet 


its real visage is easily seen by any reverser: 


look at cracking itself for instance: there seem to be no real problems for 'serial number' repositories or 'warez' depots, 


where you can find  


STOLEN programs for free even BEFORE they are


 sold in the shops (search for &quot;warez&quot;, &quot;gamez&quot; and &quot;appz&quot; on the 


search engines... you'll find a million of them)... but there are


 on the contrary continued problems for people that TEACH you for free how those  


same search engines and those same programs really work.<br>


<br>Yet you have lost, stupid censors. The thronging masses of guinea pigs are slowly 


disappearing. 


We are the ones that are growing a generation of computer users that will 


KNOW (pretty well :-) what's going on inside any program, and that will be able to 


change them as far as they fancy, 


all things that Micro$oft and others DO NOT LIKE AT ALL... they would like 


everybody to produce &quot;toy&quot; applications 


with stupid overbloated and ineffective languages, leaving them 


the task (and the rewards) to program &quot;real&quot; applications... no, no, NO!


That's incidentally also the reason WHY you should damage   


Micro$oft's interests wherever you can: this damaging 


is a good nice thing 


&quot;per se&quot;, seen 


what they have done to us (you have to wait now up to 5 minutes to fire on a Pentium II a 


wordprocessor that's 


far inferior


 to the one you would have fired in 5 seconds with old dos on a 8086, for instance)<br>


<br><center>

Each one of us will throw, for free, his own sand pebble 


inside the awful wheels of the commercial society we all live in... that's more than enough

<font size="+3"><b>Syn attacks against my sites</b> (January-May 1999)</font><br>

<br>

For many years my fortress has been continuously 

attacked by young crackers with the Billy-the-Kid syndrome 

(&quot;hey, I have nuked fravia's!&quot;). Most of these attacks were weak and easily rebuked (in 

some cases even punished :-) either by my system administrators or by myself. Some of them were nevertheless 


quite interesting and ingenious, and have been analysed in the essays that you'll find 

in my <a href="ideal.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ideal.htm">porn site busting</a> section.<br>In January 1999 however, 

a massive a well organised 

syn-attack against my fortress at http://www.fravia.org (hosted graciously by netcaf») 

frigged the local router and brought the server on its knees. <br>

The fortress was taken off until 

21 april 1999 <br>With the help of +Alistair, 

I went on a very difficoult hunt 

for my enemies, but 

from the few gathered pieces of the puzzle we could  draw only some 

vague hints.<br>The third week of April my old fortress reopened onto 

a stronger server, but -once more- a massive syn-attack frigged 

the router after less than a week on 26 april 1999.

<br>

Since the attackers began a serie of syn-attacks against my mirrors as well (forcing the 

columbia university 

mirror to close in April 1999), some friends decided to 

set up a &quot;mirror jungle&quot;. I have to thank +tsehp and Jeff (and all the others) for this 

endeavour, that underlined once more the superiority of our &quot;web of knowledge and solidarity&quot; against 

all commercial oriented zombies (I now know that this definition qualifies exactly my 

syn attackers).<br> You'll be able to find lists of my many mirrors (not all of them working) 

at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://surf.to/fravia/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://surf.to/fravia/'" tppabs="http://surf.to/fravia/">Tapu's</a> and especially at <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.jps.net/jas/fraviaMirrors.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.jps.net/jas/fraviaMirrors.html'" tppabs="http://www.jps.net/jas/fraviaMirrors.html">Jeff's</a> 

special pages.<br> 

Some of these mirrors have been purposely 

set up as &quot;lure&quot; on locations 

that allowed me to triangolate my attackers.<br>This solution was nevertheless not very elegant, and I wanted 

to re-set my fravia.org address on a &quot;panzered&quot; server. Luckily I found the help of a great 

wizard of old (nonetheless than Kevin!), that graciously (and cleverly) 

set up a very powerful multi-servers configuration 

just to hold my site. This <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://193.247.254.13/fravia.org/index.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://193.247.254.13/fravia.org/index.html'" tppabs="http://193.247.254.13/fravia.org/index.html">new fortress</a> 

 has withstood so far (October 1999) all sort of vicious attacks and is being heavily guarded and 

defended by Kevin. At one point the attackers went so far to download 

microcode to 

a Cisco router, which is not an easy, nor very common, trick at all, 

but to no avail! :-)<br>The attacks have never stopped and are currently (October 1999) being 

routinely carried out, with slightly different patterns 

against my new fortress. As you are probably reading this on my new fortress, you can imagine how 

frustrated the silly syn-attackers probably are. Since we know now that 

the most attacks 

were stardet from the West coast of the States (where the attackers 

have been documented using 8 machines from a M$-stream 

at one given time :-) some visitors from that area may experience some 

problems (basically heavy automated 

trackwork :-) when accessing from West coast USA backbones (a 

&quot;backbone&quot; is the high-traffic-density connectivity portion of 

any communications network)<br>I'll publish an  essay on the debunking of these attackers 

that should be of some 

interest for the whole reversing community... in fact as it appears, a part of the attackers 

are nothing else that commercial oriented 'mainstream' crackers... come to 

think of that, I should actually 

thank these clowns, since they gave me the opportunity to learn 

quite a lot of tricks I did not know 

of.

Note however, that some (non-disruptive) attacks are &quot;nice&quot; and extremely useful, for instance on 01 October 1999 the main page of my

<br>

Censorships attempt and useless attacks like these do not mean nothing for me. 

Since I'm not making any money with my sites, I'm not loosing any either.

<br>

The nature of our web 

is such that knowledge will always continue to flow through it, notwithstanding advertisement, 

commercial interests, 

censoring agencies and all &quot;special governmental bodies&quot; attempts :-)<br><font color="blue">

The &quot;Academy&quot;, started in March 1997, 

carries the best short essays from all

of the 

most interesting places of the whole net (at least this is what people

Reading the material offered on the academy's databases  

you'll gain an incredible amount of knowledge... (I myself did).<br>

+ORC pushed my way some of the essays he had received, the other just 

followed once the first one were publicised... +Swann has the 

merit to have started the whole snowball (Swann, you'll land on all history books :-)

<h2>The problem with the protections</h2>

You see, the problem with protection schemes, is their &quot;intrinsic&quot; nature: 

they have to remain 'secret' (else everybody would be able crack them...) 

but 'secretness' is very stupid in this new age of information... 

therefore the

protectionists COULD NOT use (until now that is :-) 

the real MIGHT of 

Internet! They could not get in contact AND exchange their 

findings... building on the shoulders of others

and I mean of people that  

THEY DO NOT EVEN KNOW TO EXIST... poor bunch of confined &quot;I know you already&quot; people! 

At most they could PGP each other some 

already well known tricks... everything among people they (thought they) could trust... 

so they  never 

got &quot;fresh blood&quot; on protection work and development... But WE CAN! Alone we are nothing, but 

joining forces we are like fingers in a fist! (Kurt Tukolsky's image... a GREAT MIND... 

read his books!

 not easy to find, though).<br><br>And crackers are NOTHING else than the other face 

of protectors, of course. And the Net, despise all 

censorship attempts, still gives us reverse engineers PLENTY 

of possibilities of joining knowledge, data and

forces FOR FREE! Our work is studied (and often ameliorated) by others! So <u>crackers 

grow</u> 

(&quot;evil&quot; lone wolf crackers and &quot;good&quot; teaching +crackers... that's just a matter of 

individual taste and leanings :-)<br><u>protectors grow</u> ('greedy' protectors and 

&quot;good&quot; teaching +protectors... that's just a matter of individual taste and leanings :-) and, 

-at times- even mighty &quot;tools-makers&quot; and &quot;reversing wizards&quot; appear. 

<br>Anyway my page is only ONE of the many sites on the web that are giving out 

knowledge... and this is VERY important! Information spreading (coupled with a certain 

degree of anonimity :-) is ALREADY cracking the fundaments of this 

awful -TV drooling zombies and commercial idiots- society...<br>Look: as 

soon as people can

 do what they like... they do it FOR FREE, 

and for everybody else to enjoy... they do not do it for money... 

funny isn't it? But true: Look at 

the web! Everything is for free! Millions of hours of work by millions of 

people that 

DO NOT KNOW each other... all this developed into 

pages where knowledge is given 

away for knowledge's

 sake! It's incredible, but true... and all commercial attempts have (until now, 

let's cross finger) failed miserably because 

of this enormous mass of people that seems to have come from another planet!<br>People 

that 

do not care for money? The slave masters cannot even understand what's going on 

under their suspicious noses... What? People giving 

something away for free? What's that? What's wrong with them? Cant be 

true!<br>Poor sods! For free we give, 

 yet not without 

some GREAT advantages for every one who spreads knowledge and works on it... 

<br><br><b>KNOWLEDGE IS KNOWLEDGE'S REWARD!<br><br></b>

you see that on this very site of mine! 

The contributes of all others ARE 

 advantages for each one of you... and that's exactly what the commercial minds hate... 

That's why our enemies keep 

trying to grind all Internet wheels, in order to get a &quot;dependent&quot; Internet, 

with some Micro$oft  &quot;TV-channel-MSN&quot; 

awful systems and all other &quot;push&quot; attempts (where people will get only what the slave  

masters have chosen), that's the reason of

 much censorship and that's the reason behind all other PASSIVIZING Internet efforts 

they are working on... our enemies do not like 

at all people CHOOSING what they want, DECIDING ALONE what they would like to do, able 

to 

MODIFY (or refuse or rebuke) the technology they use everyday... 

our enemies need CONSUM SLAVES in order to make money... people that think are dangerous... 

they could even come one day to 

the dreadful idea to ACT POLITICALLY and put an end to an absurd society where money, 

not knowledge, means power (why?), where millions of human beings are  

closed in urban ghettos 

to pray on each other (and eliminate each other physically) instead of being helped to 

develop themselves. A ugly society where men and women are kept running inside 

guinea-pig wheels, 

idiotized by useless TV-channels that are OWNED by their masters. Our planet has 

been transformed in an awful 

place, where you are compelled to 

<u>spend</u> your whole life in order to &quot;earn&quot; it... where poetry and philosophy are 

judged irrelevant and only money (and bad taste) rule.<br><br> 

The &quot;slave masters&quot; cannot therefore understand us, they   

understand only the old (scary) pre-Internet world, a dim grey world of people &quot;hiding&quot; 

knowledge in order of taking advantage of it... instead of spreading it for 

free to anybody who cares ...<br><br>BAD LUCK! Poor stupid slave masters... You DO NOT 

OWN INTERNET! And therefore you have already lost! 

LOOK <a href="academy.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/academy.htm">HERE</a>! :-) 

Look at the intrinsic and evident &quot;development&quot; of the essays! 

Nothing on the Web demonstrates better than this the MIGHT of common people joining 

forces WITHOUT repulsive &quot;sponsors&quot;, dirty &quot;lobbies&quot; or useless publicity ads! 

No money at 

all... yet HUNDRED of  individual like us, offering away THOUSANDS of 

hours of (difficult) work to people that may not even care to thank... 

we are offering a knowledge, as you will be able to see by yourself, that 

you will NOT find elsewhere, no matter how much you would 

pay for it... therefore, see... <font color="blue">&quot;free&quot; beats &quot;commercial&quot; 

in spades</font>!<br>(Besides, the web was built in order to resist ATOMIC BOMBING, it will 

easily resist any ADVERTISEMENT BOMBING as well :-)<br><br><font size="+2">
