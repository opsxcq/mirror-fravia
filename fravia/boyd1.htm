Invaluable list if you know or learn how to use these beasts. This is GOLD information, and you

probably did not even deserve

to find it. Boyd is the famous

master accmailer one of the few brave gods

that still keeps running the spirit of the "web of old".<BR>

My advice? Read the various <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALIGN=CENTER HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=13

lessons first, if you didn't do that already and -before using the more complex beasts below-

email the addresses below with the word

"help" (without quotes) both in the 'subject' and in the 'text' fields of your email...<BR>My own

preferred

ones? Depends from the year... these things evolve: the web is just quicksand...<BR><BR>

<FONT size=+3>THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCMAIL</FONT><BR>by fravia+, July 1999<BR>

<HR width=44%></CENTER>

<FONT size=+3>L</FONT>et's get straight to the point: Accessing the web per email is NOT just an

'ancient' mode to surf, it is -or rather could be - a very powerful WEAPON in our fight against

the silly commercialization of the web, against powerful market-forces (an euphemism for "greedy

profit-oriented sad bastards", as usual ready to transform your web-life in  an advertisement

clicking inferno to scrap a couple of dollars).  These forces are continuously "pushing frills

and punishing content" on the whole net, and dare call this 'evolution'. The final aim is a net

of slaves, assembled and herded from portal to portal inside a dark tunnel of advertising

banners, stroboscopic publicity displays and pushed false information. Consumer-livestock, that's

what web-surfers should transform themselves into according to the pundits whose bank accounts

depend on that.

<BR>

Unfortunately  this rant of mine does not mean much in the real (sad) society where we live. Ah!

But do not despair: there are other <U>very sound</U> reasons to access the web per email! And

I'm going to list them here for the unawares and the younger ones.<BR><BR><HR width=88%>

<B>Reducing costs, saving time</B><BR>

The world is NOT the States. Almost everywhere local calls must be paid. Downloading (is just an

example:-) that huge "softice version 4" package with its 15.000.000 bytes (Numega is going

Micro$oftish :-( can take anything between 15 and 45 minutes in the European Union, who knows how

long in Gabon or in Mongolia. That's time you have to pay for÷ unless you learn to use the

accmail techniques.<BR>



Once more (I repeat because I know that few seem to grasp this): <B>YES!</B> You can download for

free whatever you want, wherever you want and get it sent to you per email at the address you

prefer. You can anonymously use the ftpservers or the www4 ones and get your targets on some

pseudo address of yours. Let's imagine you have an Internet provider that gives to you six hour

on the net every month for free, all other hours  you have to pay for.<BR>

Well, six hours per month are MORE than enough if you master the accmail techniques! You can

download infinite web pages, receive several mailing list and peruse them off-line, and you will

also have time to learn a plethora of other interesting things that have been forgotten or are

ignored by all those " only online" zombies (remailers, echoes, veronikas, gopher, fax, and so

on). Your telephone bill will not grow either. And you will never loose time waiting for a slow

page to download: all pages or programs or images will come <U>by mail</U> at the full speed of

your ISP-modem connection, not at some wacky net connection with Godzilla knows where at low

speed and ftp-busy risk.<BR>

Yes, no wonder that very big market forces have all interest

to let you never learn of the mere existence of accmail methods.

Accessing the web per email is a revolutionary technique! It relies on the "web of old" spirit,

when everything was for free and for anybody to have for the sake of knowledge, not in order to

be spammed by some pathetical widget-selling clown.

<BR><BR><HR width=88%>

<B>Revenge of the third world</B><BR>

Yes, the web is NOT the States.<BR>

Internet / e-mail connectivity and access is becoming cheaper (and, in some cases,

free) in the developed countries (this is of course paid through the fact that it takes longer to

find the information you are looking for in a sea of garbage masquerade trough frills) the case

is different in the developing countries. Recent data that shows that, compared to the USA, full

internet access costs 4 times more in India, 5 times more in Kenya, and 6 times more in Armenia.

Based on hearsay, it can be said that the situation in other South Asian, African and Eastern

Europe countries is not that different. The economical reasons listed above are even more

stringent for third world inhabitants: if you are reading this now and come from a third world

country, the best thing you can probably do in your whole life is to cut and pest the following

snippet, print it and distribute it to all those that you meet that have only email access to the

web.



<FONT color=blue><PRE>

For all those of you that never knew about the complex

and fascinating accmail world, here is the gate to it:

(Small courtesy of fravia+ and big courtesy of G.E.Boyd)



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ACCMAIL Info ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To SUBscribe: Send SUBSCRIBE ACCMAIL to LISTSERV@LISTSERV.AOL.COM

To UNSUBscribe: Send UNSUBSCRIBE ACCMAIL to LISTSERV@LISTSERV.AOL.COM

To get the ACCMAIL FAQ: Send e-mail to "mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu"

and enter only this line in the BODY of the note:

send usenet/news.answers/internet-services/access-via-email

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

</PRE></FONT>



Believe me: those that will get the above snippet from you

will thank you their life long.<BR>

<B>Anonymity and corporate captivity</B><BR>

As anyone that has read my <A href="corporate.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/corporate.htm">corporate</A> page and

my <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/noanon.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/noanon.htm'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/noanon.htm"">anonymity</A> pages knows, there is not much you can do when

you sit inside tour cubicle and all your web-acess to the world is

filtered to see if you are being productive, or if you are seeking another

job (as you should by all means do if you are in such an environment) or

if you are looking for images on alt.lick.my.shoes.<BR>

Well, there's not much you can do, but one of the most interesting

things you could do

is to use some accmail techniques. Email is still considered somehow

"personal".<BR>

They snoop email allright of course, but they will not

be so ready to use against you  your email usage, or to be catch doing

it, since you could easily accuse them to snoop on your private

sphere if they did. Let's put it this way: stupid and Internet-ignorant

judges will (probably) condemn you

for having used the Internet access gently provided by your masters in order to see evil pages,

but will

(probably) condemn your principal for having snooped on your holy private email.<BR>You see

now another case for accessing the web per email.<BR>Keeping on the same anonymity track,

accessing per email will also teach you quite a lot more about where you are really going and

where

from are coming the things you get than through web-graphical access. I won't repeat here all the

concealed  things that your browser does on your hard disk every time you access some site and

all the things people can learn about your life and preferred search strings every time you

browse around smearing your personal data allover the net. All this

will be cut down accessing per email, of course. A complete anonymity is an impossible dream, but

some sort of anonymity will be available at no cost.<BR><BR>

Et de hoc satis.<BR>
