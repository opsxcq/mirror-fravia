 CLICKBOOK - Stupid Protection / Tools of the trade By VisualBB



I also had the opportunity to get a program that is useful for us -

CLICKBOOK from forefront the makers of Quick view pro that Essential

utility. It condenses printouts into booklet form.



This program "DEMO" can be got at:



http://www.ffg.com/wp/clickbook.html



It prints booklets that are a great paper saver. Only thing is the

damn demo prints a box on every page with the words "TRIAL VERSION" as

well as the site address - "www.ffg.com". This was too irritating for

words and so I ran it thru WDASM looking for the words Trial Version

which were found scattered all over.



While examining the code I noticed that every time a shareware notice

as present there was also a normal notice. This seemed to be too easy.

Also the program checked location 00401E6E and if 0 jumped to good and

anything else was bad and demo.



So I searched for this location to see where the flag was being set. I

found it being set at 3 locations. 



Set breakpoints and start the debugger of wdasm32 ( which I find

easier to follow than SICE though not as powerful. We break at the

first breakpoint I set which was a call to a function that returned 1

in EAX which was loaded into our 00401E6E and then CMPared . So I

changed the 1 to 0 in ax and ran. No initial nagscreen but still the

box was present. Obviously the value was being changed elsewhere.



Load the program again this time trace into the call. and after

stepping a lot and after a check to some value in the registry, we

arrive at this code:



:004346E5 7518                    jne 004346FF

:004346E7 3BC8                    cmp ecx, eax

:004346E9 7514                    jne 004346FF

:004346EB 83F906                  cmp ecx, 00000006

:004346EE 750F                    jne 004346FF



* Possible Reference to String Resource ID=00001: "Pass B"

                                  |

:004346F0 B801000000              mov eax, 00000001 <HERE!!!

:004346F5 5F                      pop edi

:004346F6 5E                      pop esi

:004346F7 5B                      pop ebx

:004346F8 81C4CC000000            add esp, 000000CC

:004346FE C3                      ret



Since we cannot be registered (no provision in the program) we always

arrive at the code "marked.class" tppabs="http://fravia.org/marked.class" HERE!!! where we observe EAX being loaded

with the BAD flag - 1. Surely it cannot be that easy?



Believe me IT IS. Change the mov eax, 1 to mov eax, 0 and let the

program run. Print a document and preview, no box spoiling the output.

Thats it. We are done. Except for the ABOUT  dialog saying we are not

registered, the program works beautifully and even displays

"Registered to" on the main screen.

Find it on da web... you are supposed to be a master searcher :)

    

Hi frav, 

Here they protz a little, yet read and you'll understand why I 

wanted to try it out, and why you'll want to try it out and 

why everyone will want to try it out:<FONT color=purple>

Download a website for off-line browsing, which means you can 

view the entire site on your own computer much faster than if 

you were on-line.  And, you save money on dial-up costs, too!

Duplicate or mirror a website, including the directory structure.  

Great for webmasters and web designers to see how a website 

is setup.

Copy e-mail addresses referenced in a websiteís HTML files. 

These e-mail addresses can later be exported into a comma or 

tab delimited database file.  The applications of this range 

from simple research to broadcast e-mail marketing.

Build a map of the HTML files referenced in a website.  

Need to know the structure of a remote website?  This is 

your tool.

Search for specific keywords on a website.  Get the information 

you need in a flash.

Retrieve specific types of files like all the cool graphics, 

sounds (WAV files), or movies (AVI files).  WebSnake automatically 

downloads anything you want quickly and easily.</FONT>

                PROTEXE V2.11 - TOM TROFS

             EXPLORING THE PROTECTION SCEHME

                          BY

                 THE UNDERTAKER -=BANDA=-





After a long period of busy shedule. Finally I managed to start my reverse

engineering essays. Today we will explore a another EXE protector called

PROTEXE. Exploring the EXE protectors you will learn a lot. Because normally

they use good encription & anti debugging tricks. Most of the time they use

Vector replacement, Self modifying code, Anti debugging tricks. Some of them

uses very good protection schemes. Truly hard to crack those. Ok lets get

back to work. First, protect a EXE file using PROTEXE. Now set up our

favorite tool soft-ice 2.80 for DOS (Yes: dos cracking is great fun!).



Load your protected EXE file using Symbolic Loader (LDR).



LDR lha.exe <NOW you are in Soft-Ice window, Before we analyse the code "we.class" tppabs="http://fravia.org/we.class" need to study

the X86 flag register.





                FLAGS - Intel 8086 Family Flags Register

                   ¿ŸŸŸŸŸŸ  VM  Virtual Mode Flag (386+ only)





Ok, lets explore the first few instructions in the protected program....





XXXX:0147 9C            PUSHF             -- Save The Flag Register

XXXX:0148 9C            PUSHF             -- Pushed again to get into AX

XXXX:0149 58            POP     AX        -- AX Contains Current Flag Settings

XXXX:014A 25FF0F        AND     AX,0FFF   -- Discard upper 4 nibbles (msb)

XXXX:014D 50            PUSH    AX        -- Save modified flags

XXXX:014E 9D            POPF              -- Use modified Flags.

                        .

XXXX:0159 9C            PUSHF

XXXX:015A 58            POPF

XXXX:015B 25FF0F        AND     AX,0FFF  -- Discard Upper 4 niblles

XXXX:015E 0D0070        OR      AX,7000  -- If TF is on, Off it

XXXX:0161 50            PUSH    AX

XXXX:0162 58            POPF



Well above part is to disable the Trap Flag. If the Trap Flag is on then

processor switch back to single step mode. Most universal Unpackers uses 

this method to trace through the code. Ok lets analyse the code further 

down.



XXXX:016A BA6400        MOV     DX,064

XXXX:016D BOAD          MOV     AL,AD

XXXX:016F EB01          JMP     172      -- ***

XXXX:0171 88EE          MOV     DH,CH



Above part is to disable the keyboard. but there is a jump it is 

directed to OFFSET:172. In the code there is no 172. Ok it is a 

self modifying stuff in it.

Opcode for OUT DX,AL is EE. See DX & AL  setup for the keyboard disable. 

But there is no OUT DX,AL. Well check the jump it is directed to 

172. In offset 172 you will find the opcode EE. Here you got it once 

jump executed the code changed to OUT DX,AL.



Code MOV DH,CH has no effect until the jump instruction executed. Within 

the code you will find lot of these JMP's directed to OUT DX,AL. Ignore all 

of them and countinue.



XXXX:0186 33C0          XOR     AX,AX

XXXX:0188 8ED8          MOV     DS,AX

XXXX:018A FF360C00      PUSH    [000C]

XXXX:018E FF360E00      PUSH    [000E]

XXXX:0192 B84602        MOV     AX,246   -- **

XXXX:0195 A30C00        MOV     [000C],AX

XXXX:0198 8C0E0E00      MOV     [000E],CS



Ok, Check above code. Mmmm It seems to be a Vector replacemet for 

interrupt 3.

Yes it is, Most of the debuggers & universal unpackers uses int 3. 

Replacing the int3 code to something else may hang these type of 

debuggers & unpackers.

Lets check what is replaceing the existing int 3 code. New interrupt 

service routine for int 3 is located at CS:246 (chek the code).



Normally Int3 code has only IRET instruction. Lets check the new int3 

ISR...



U 246



XXXX:0246 8ED8          MOV     DS,AX

XXXX:0248 CF            IRET



In here int3 used  to copy the contains of AX to DS.. Let's explore the 

code again..



If you are going through the code, You will find lot of Keyboard disable

routines & interrupt masking(keyboard Int masking) routines inside the 

code.

Bypass all of them (I think everybody knows to bypass those lame tricks) 

and next you will landed on CRC checking routine. Go through the code until 

you find this.



XXXX:020B 81FEF78A      CMP     SI,8AF7

XXXX:020F 72B0          JB      1C1

XXXX:0211               PUSH    DX       -- **



Put a Break Point on XXXX:0211. Otherwise it will loop you until SI=8AF7.



BPX 211 & go (F5)



Again you will see keyboard & interrupt Enable routines in the code 

window. Go through the code until you see this..



XXXX:022E 81FA2877      CMP     DX,7728

XXXX:0232 7415          JZ      249      -- **



This part is to check the calculated CRC with the program contains. If 

match go ahead. Else you will landed in a CRC failed message & dump into dos. 

Mmmm Ok go through the code until you see this.





XXXX:02D2 EB01          JMP     2D5

XXXX:02D4 88EE          MOV     DH,CH

XXXX:02D6 EA0000C615    JMP     15C6:0000 -- *******



Above FAR JMP take you to the original code of your programm...



Well in this PROTEXE you will find different types of protection 

methods. They are..



        # FLAG register Masking. (TF MASK)

        # Vector Replacement.

        # Keyboard & interrupt Masking.

        # Self Modifying Code.

        # CRC Checking.



Above methods are good. But the sad protector's only (MAIN) problem 

is what I would call an "implementation lacks". 

I think that the Coder only tried to protect the program from 

LAMERS. Otherwise he would of course have implemented this program 

better than that.



I think All the protection writers <u>have to think twice</U>

It is true this is a dammn "windows" age, I'm afraid. 

Yet there are still quite a lot of good reverse engineers in 

this Micro$oft 'tamed' world :-)



Ok, now for the most stupid readers, Using a hex editor you can change few opcodes in 

this

program. Find those opcodes and change. Then use TRON to unpack it. 

Shhhhh!

If you have any problems contact me...





I would like to read your comments. 

You can write to me on following email address..



                undertakerd@hotmail.com







NOTE - If you compressed the program before running protexe. Then above

       OFFSET address can be changed. Also you can down load the PROTEXE

<FONT SIZE=7><CENTER>Cracking Norton Antivirus Trial Edition

<BR>By ThunderLord</CENTER><FONT>

<FONT SIZE=4>

<BR>At first lets take a look at the directory where all the files were installed. It containes several executables. Four of them are the files which run the main virus scanner, resident virus scanner, sheduler and a rescue disk creation utility.

<BR>The first strange thing is that those files are all exactly the same size, about 160 kb. That seemed quite strange for those completly different executables, but my first thought was, that they were wrapped against viral protection.

<BR>The protection consisted of a nag screen with amount of trial days left, which appeared at the startup and asked to press the "still on trial" button. There was a possibility to register the package on-line using the internet or modem, but no place wher!

e to enter the serial number. That's probably because Symantec decided not to provide telephone lines for direct ordering.

<BR>One of the first funny ideas which popped in my head was to hack the winsock.dll to provide a fake registration, but then I declined the idea as beeing too complicated :)

<BR>

<BR>So lets begin with the first step:

<BR>I launched the WDASM and quickly produced a dead listing of the main scanner executable NAVW32. At the same time I extracted the resources from it using Borland C++ 5.0 and took a long look at all dialog boxes, remembering their id's.

<BR>

<BR><I>One little sidestep: sometimes I prefer to use Micro$oft Developer Studio, because Borland's Tool tends to crush when processing the menus:( Using Bill's tool I always get a strange warning messagebox, saying: "You may be anable to save the resources!

 back to file, because you are probably using a version of operation system which does not support editing the resourses in the executables". AHA ! Well, Borland's editor doesn't seem to have this problem, Bill !. You are trying to scare me off from editing!

 the Micro$ofts own programs. Well, lets get back to our NAVW32...

<BR></I>

<BR>Trying to look at the resourses in other files and after reading a number of colorfull dialogs, I found out that Symantec is not using their own protection sheme, but some company which provides online registering service of different software. They eve!

n have a whole DLL containg a so called "Sales Agent". Strange thing that I found some references to Micro$oft Front Page in those dialogs, that probably means, that Micro$oft are also using that "Sales Agent".

<BR>

<BR>After finding the id of the dialog which popped up at the startup I quickly searched for it in the dead list. The following code was interesting:

<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier" SIZE=2>

<BR>:004024B2 cmp dword ptr [0042173C], 00000000

<BR>:004024B9 jne 0040260D <JUMP over MANY dialogboxparam's

<BR>...

<BR>:004024C6 cmp dword ptr [004200BC], 00000000

<BR>:004024CD push 004027B0

<BR>:004024D2 push eax

<BR>:004024D3 je 004024D9

<BR>...

<BR>Set up a dialog for some other product and jump to 004024E2

<BR>...

<BR>:004024D9 push 00000067 <ID of OUR naggin dialog

<BR>:004024DB mov ecx, dword ptr [0041D344]

<BR>:004024E1 push ecx

<BR>:004024E2 Call USER32.DialogBoxParamA

<BR>...

<BR>MANY different dialog boxes

<BR>...

<BR></FONT>

<BR>Well as you can see the our dialog box is lying in the chain of other dialog boxes for some other nagscreens and stuff... But the first thing which poppes up is the cmp instruction at the first line. It looks very suspicious as it jumps over the bunch o!

f the nagscreens, and the location in memory looks very much like a flag !

<BR>I tryed Softicing it and found out, that memory location is only touched once befor this compare... it is zeroed somewhere in the startup code ! So there is a quick crack:

<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier" SIZE=2>

<BR>:004024B2 mov dword ptr [0042173C], 00000001 <PLACE a fake flag

<BR>:004024B9 jmp 0040260D <JUMP over MANY dialogboxparam's

<BR></FONT>

<BR>The move is nessesary, cause there can be more places where the flag is checked, but this place is the First.

<BR>The main scanner is done... no more nagging. Other four executables are cracked similary, they are compiled exactly as this, even with the same opcodes at the same addreses. This comfirmes that the files were processed by Sales Agent wrapper.

<BR>

<BR>Suddenly after a few days of using the software I adjusted my system clock and a window from the resident scanner popped up saying that I am using a timed software and I may not change the time. I realised that there are some more places where the files!

 need to be patched.

<BR>I set my clock to year 1999, and loaded the NAVW32 in to the SoftIce again and quickly patched it in one more place.

<BR>I thought that the crack was done when I suddenly noticed that there were loading two copies of the resident scanner one as an executable another as a dll. That looked like a very "unclean" crack, so I decided to take a very serious look at the whole th!

ing again.

<BR>In the installation directory I found a few executable files which were called almost the same as the main scanner, resident scanner, and other antivira tools, but they were ending with POP, like NAVW3POP.EXE. Theese files also had a exact size and even!

 icon. I launched one and got a standart windows animated "file copying" dialog box which terminated in a few seconds and showed an error message saying:

<BR>"You can't run this program now, but leave it where it is because the system will need it later". Hey that looks like some kinda selfextracting installation file.

<BR>

<BR>I loaded it in the wdasm peeked at it's code... Some interesting opcodes were found:

<BR><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier" SIZE=2>

<BR>...

<BR>Animated dialog which shows files beeing copied

<BR>...

<BR>:00401F30 Call KERNEL32.SleepEx <THEY want us to see their creative dialog for 2 seconds :)

<BR>:00401F36 call 00401CF0 <SOME naughty routine which tends to return an error code "of.class" tppabs="http://fravia.org/of.class" -1 or 0 for beggar or 1 for coolguy

<BR>:00401F3B cmp eax, FFFFFFFF <COMPARE to minus one

<BR>:00401F3E mov ebx, eax <MAKE a copy of error code "for.class" tppabs="http://fravia.org/for.class" future reference

<BR>:00401F40 jne 00401F4E <IF not -1, then DON'T QUIT YET

<BR>

<BR>:00401F42 push 00000000 <HERE the program quits

<BR>:00401F44 mov esi, USER32.PostQuitMessage

<BR>:00401F4A call esi

<BR>:00401F4C jmp 00401F54 <GET outta here, beggar

<BR>

<BR>;DON'T QUIT YET, just "prepare" for quit, cause BX can still hold 0 or 1

<BR>:00401F4E mov esi, USER32.PostQuitMessage

<BR>

<BR>:00401F54 test ebx, ebx <IF BX=-1 or BX=1 then goto msgebox with error

<BR>:00401F56 jne 00401F8F <IMPORTANT JUMP

<BR>...

<BR>;Quitting with a messagebox containing "You cannot run this application at this time."

<BR>...

<BR>:00401F71 mov edi, USER32.MessageBoxA

<BR>...

<BR>:00401F87 call edi

<BR>:00401F89 push 00000000

<BR>:00401F8B call esi <ESI is PostQuitMessage as you remember from above

<BR>:00401F8D jmp 00401F95 <JUMPING outta the program

<BR>

<BR>;IMPORTANT JUMP lands here

<BR>:00401F8F mov edi, USER32.MessageBoxA <PREPARE a message box

<BR>:00401F95 cmp ebx, 00000001 <SECOND IMPORTANT JUMP which finaly checks for a valid return code "of.class" tppabs="http://fravia.org/of.class" a coolguy

<BR>:00401F98 jne 0040203C <IF not 1 at this time then gettoutta here beggar

<BR>...

<BR>;Cool Guy operations go here (like unpacking the executable)

<BR>...

<BR>:0040203C xor eax, eax <RETURN indicating that a bad guy

<BR>...

<BR>:00402047 ret 0010

<BR></FONT>

<BR>As you can see, the code loads EDI and ESI with addresses to PostQuitMessage and MessageBox, threatning to call them if the value in EBX is not equal to 1. Therfor the patch should put a value of 1 in the BX somewhere after the naughty routine call and !

before the great EBX checking starts...

<BR>This task can you perform yourself, because when I first cracked it I was tired and therfor patched the previous code in TWO locations...but now I can see a pretty easy to do it in one.

<BR>After patching the file is unpacking without any trouble and it replaces the "fake" wrapped Symantec Utilities with a real, clean, and without any nags utilities. The patch is performed on all 4 *POP.EXE files which have the same code at the same adress!

es. After the execution of the poppers they may be deleted together with the SalesAgent DLL. You can even patch those poppers in the softice memory and let it run afterwards unpacking the whole thing, the crack only needs to be there on their first run. Tha!

t was it, Norton AntiVirus Trial Edition is cracked.

<BR>

<BR><I><B>Note at the end:</B> There is a single DOS application included in the Symantec package, which is used under the boot before Windows loads. Because it is a DOS application I didn't take a look at it, as I prefer cracking win stuff, so if there are!

 somebody who can finish my work they are welcomed to make any additions to this essay.

			Winimage Version 2.50

		How to make a MSGBOX work for YOU 

			      by RMD+



There are probably many others like me who are still learning how 

to crack or aren't very good assembly programmers and yet want to 

write Keygenerators or who are too lazy to rip out the code 

in order to write one. 

In this essay I want to show how to turn a target program into a 

Keygenerator by getting the Msgbox that says that your entered 

number is incorrect (or correct) to show you the "secret" password 

instead.



The idea for this came from one of our masters tutorials, 

where +he said about how ECHOs of the proper serial Number 

are left lying about in the data window.



Fire Up Winimage go to the Registering bit and enter your 

name and a fake serial, so in my case RMD+ and 12345.



CTRL+D to SOFTICE 

and 

BPX GETDLGITEMTEXTA



go back to Winimage and press enter



The program should now have immediately broken into 

SICE in the middle of the call, so press F11 to return.



Disable ypur breakpoint by BD 00



Now if you look above this @ 0040579E you see the 

following: 



0040579E MOV ESI,004252D0

004957A3 PUSH ESI



if you d esi you see that you name was copied into ESI 

and then ESI was added onto the stack



now if you F10 past the next GETDLGITEMTEXTA you see 

your serial num get put into EDI.



Keep on F10-ing till you get to 



00405827 call 0040F238 ;Enter this call here 



Our approach here is we know that our ECHO is near to the 

Msgbox text that says "Registering Information are bad". 

So what we've done is enter the call that loads that 

information into memory.



If you F10 down to 



0040F242 LEA EAX,[EBP+FFFFFF14] ;you see the text 

				;string "Reg info bad" 



now, you should of course dump that memory: 

  	 d EBP+FFFFFF14

and if you look around that area you'll see the correct 

registration code at 0067F31C and you'll also see another 

copy at 0067F33C, but for the purpose of this short study 

we'll use the one @ 0067F31C ('cos the other one gets 

written over)



If you carry on single stepping you'll get to 



0040F250 PUSH EAX

0040F251 PUSH DWORD PTR [EBP+0C]

0040F254 CALL 00410D47  ;here is where the string for the Msgbox 

			 caption is loaded which overwrites the 

			 second serial



if you single step to 40F277 and dump memory there, you'll 

see that the MSGBOX text is getting put into ECX and then 

ECX gets put onto the stack.



THIS IS THE IMPORTANT BIT



If you look, you'll see that our serial number is @ 0067F31C 

and that the EDX register is zero. So assemble line 0040F277 

to load <U>the serial number text</U> instead of the Msg text 

by doing the following:



a 0040F277 {PRESS ENTER}

  LEA ECX,[EDX+0067F31C] {PRESS ENTER}



now if you carry on pressing F10 you'll see the correct serial 

number coming up for whatever name you have given as input.



So here is the patch for this:



in you HEX editor load the EXE file and search for 8D8D14FFFFFF then 

replace this info with 8D8A1CF36700, save, and then try it out.



Now every time you want a serial number just enter whatever name 

you fancy and BINGO!



Note that this is not the best clean patch of the world, of course, 

and that also it occasionaly gives garbage for a particolar password. 

It's just pure fun AND a different approach about what you can do 

when the correct Number is ECHO'd in memory.



Anyway I hope somebody finds it useful 



RMD+
