<I>In an old comics of "Mandrake the Magician" (the very old ones are incredibly 

interesting for advanced reversing purposes) there was a war, in some other 

dimension, between a civilisation based on plants and a civilisation based on 

machines. Incredibly 'ecologically correct' for those times: Mandrake himself (with Lothar, of course) was sort of 'caught' between the 

two completely different society models at war. The 'plant' society had a lot of 

quite 'modern' ecological stuff (like genetic transformed trees that grew houses and 

flying seeds for transport purposes) and the 'machine' society was pretty scary, in fact 

it had only <U>one</U> habitant, 

a sort of 'rebel' that always did run some personal activity, 

all alone, since everybody else was 

'enjoying life' without doing anything at all, served and entertained by machines. 

All the other habitants died because they 

 simply went 'too dick', since they almost never moved and lived more and more in a 'virtual 

reality'... remember me of somebody like us... yeah, 

this is a good introduction for Cioff's work below... at least I like it.<BR><BR>...ah 

yes, finally, thanks Mandrake, the 

'lonely machine survivor' happily married the queen of plants... a typical 

American happy end that will <U>not</U> 

bless our future... since we definitely miss the ecological counterpart to the machine and obesity world...</I>

Dear Fravia+ I'll make another go for the beef. A little more cooked

this time, I hope - not only a shopping list from +ORC's supermarket. My

intention is to explain without pressing ready-made cracks on the

readience

(not an audience in this medium, I'm afraid). But my ability may not be

fully up to my ambitions. You may need to edit it, or you could wait

until

your restructuring of your site has reached this essay. The editorial

privileges,

as always, are yours. But I hope you are using a good old DOS program to

edit it. For example the editor in PCTOOLS (before Symantec). I came

across

version 7 the other day. It even does hexediting. My old 486 has got a

new life - forget about old LoseDOwS 3.1. The real WIN -DOS 5.0 outruns

it. And I had almost forgotten in my relief from being released from

WordPerfect..



<P>Regards Cioff

Cracking some official thinking from a major drug company</H2>

The drug industry - you haven't really noticed it, have you? They're the

good guys, helping off with all those wonderful drugs against those

horrible

lethal diseases. And helping the less sick to a better life.



<P>Drugs are expensive because there's got to be so much research to

find

them. Endless laboratories with incredible bright Nobel laureates doing

all this glorious brainwork. Millions and millions of rats. Millions and

millions of people for tests. So when these drugs reach the market, they

are all safe and effective.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<H3>

Digression (?)</H3>

OK. I've had a kidney transplant. I need drugs to make me keep my

kidney.

So they've put me on ciclosporin (sorry, Sandimmun Neoral from Novartis

- the only one) and some other drugs. The major one is the ciclosporin,

though (nice name for a biker's drug, btw). Without it I would soon be

without my kidney and back into dialysis twice a week. The process would

not be a very nice one, either.



<P>It doesn't cost me much, really. About the equivalent of a bicycle

wheel

per year (150 Euro). Did you say drugs were expensive? Not to me,

anyway.



<P>But theres a snag. My daily dose of 300 milligrams costs about 15

Euro.

5500 per year. I would probably be able to afford it, but I'd rather

not.



<P>So it is paid my my national Social Security system. Those nice

people

who use other people's tax money to pay my expenses. Most people think

it's OK, by the way, to pay this part of my expenses . Nobody would like

to have my kidney and my drugs. They'd rather have their own.



<P>Sandimmun is a rather low-profile drug towards the public (not like

Valium or Prozac or Viagra). It is used by a few patients, relatively

speaking,

and prescribed by specialists for rare diseases or sub specialists in

the

transplantation hospitals, and nobody wishes to prescribe or use it

except

when in dire need. Price doesn't really matter to the decision. The drug

is expensive, but the patients are few, and hi-tech medicine always

carries

status. High transplantation rates are nice to boast about for the

politicians

and physicians.



<P>But waitaminute. The price of Sandimmun kills, though not in my

country.

In a poor country this price does kill. If I were a transplant patient

of a poor country, My Sandimmun costs could pay a lot of polio vaccine

or measles vaccine or intestinal worm killers or antimalarials or

antituberculosis

drugs&nbsp; (if you went to the world market to buy them&nbsp; - from

India,

for example). The expenses for one single person will deprive whole

villages

of medicines altogether. Either the transplanted person will die, or all

those others. The hell of a choice of you have a conscience.



<P>Anyway, the ruling class of the poor countries don't care about the

poor. They rather pay for the excecutive jets, or the St. Peter

Cathedral

replicas, or the guns and tanks and fighter planes, or the fortified

Mercedes

Benzes).



<P>Novartis gets away with this price without a public outrage because

transplantations are mainly carried out in the rich countries that can

afford it. And transplantations in the poor countries are mainly done on

the rich, who have already stolen the money they need.



<P>OK, I'm digressing.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>Back to those nice people in the industry. Everybody believes in

these

guys. So of course - the stock market likes them as well. They're the

winners

- and they deserve it.



<P>Wellcome were the ones with the first anti-AIDS drug: Retrovir -

zidovudine,

also known as AZT. You know AZT, don't you? The wonder drug (for a

while)

which was approved prematurely because the manufacturer had made the

American

homosexuals believe that this drug was THE cure and had to get

immediately

on the market to save the lives. It was a disappointment, as you all

know.



<P>Later on Wellcome were bought (Was it 12 000 000 000 Euros, or was it

more - I don't remember exactly) by the UK firm Glaxo and fused into

Glaxo

Wellcome.



<P>Later new drugs arrived, and today, with triple therapy with the

protease

inhibitors and the reverse transcriptase inhibitors - well, the HIV

infected

people don't die of AIDS any more when they are given this drug

combination.

At a price, of course. The drugs are highly profitable.



<P>Anyway: Glaxo Wellcome obviously are among the heroes in the struggle

against AIDS. Let's see what's on their minds. And for simplicity: let's

go to the Web.



<P>Fravia+ has taught me a lot about searching. But this time I resort

to simple guessing and just type www.glaxowellcome.com in the location

window of Netscape - and it's a hit.



<P>The site says nothing, but transfers me nicely into the United

Kingdom

site.



<P><A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk/'" tppabs="http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk/">http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk</A>



<P>And what do we find on the homepage?!: A menu. Some quite trivial

scientific

stuff, and some spam. But one item on it is a literature odyssey. mmm -

Interesting. The scientific thinking of the company. Its philosophy. Its

ethics. So we take a look.



<P>Some subjects we leave alone for a while - like AIDS and hepatitis C.

And asthma. If you have read my previous essays on Fravia+' site, you

might

know some of my points of view. Anyway, those pages seem harder to

crack.

Maybe later. So we delve into today's winner, the easy crack:

<I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT

SIZE=+3>Introduction</FONT></FONT></I></H2>

<FONT SIZE=+1><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In the past two decades,

obesity has emerged as an increasingly important healthcare problem

around

the world, with both developed and developing countries experiencing a

dramatic increase in its prevalence. It is estimated that about 100

million

people now have a body mass index greater than

30.</FONT></I>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;



<P><FONT SIZE=-2>Body mass index: Take my mass, 75 kg, and my height,

165

cm. This gives a body mass index of 75/(1.65x1.65)=28 (Cioff's

comment).</FONT>&nbsp;

<BR><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The trend reflects

economic

changes taking place in the developing world, as well as a global

tendency

towards urbanization and the use of labour-saving machinery.

Furthermore,

as distribution systems improve and people's disposable income

increases,

more tasty, variable, and rich food becomes available to more people. As

a result, more people are overeating at a time when their energy

expenditure

is dropping. The energy balance equation is shifted positively and

populations

relentlessly gain weight.</FONT></FONT></I>&nbsp;



<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The United States

exemplifies

the rapid change that has occurred in the prevalence of gross

overweight.

According to the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

(nhanes), which was carried out on a representative sample of the

population

from 1988 to 1991, 33% of the American public is obese. This represents

an increase of eight percentage points since the previous N.Hanes survey

one decade ago, when 25% of the population was found to be obese. Some

groups of people are particularly at risk, such as African American

women.

The prevalence of obesity in this group has risen to 48.5%, and to as

high

as 60% in African American women aged between 40 and 60. In Britain, the

number of clinically obese people has doubled in the past 10 years to

17%

of men and 13% of women. More than 50% of the population are

overweight.</FONT></FONT></I>&nbsp;

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Horrible, isn't it?

I suppose it's facts. Nothing to crack.Then there are lengthy chapters

about causes and sophisticated studies on metabolism. I don't want to go

into the details; they are code cracking exercises. In this essay I go

for the Zen crack.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></CENTER>



<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>So we make an

unconditional

jump to the treatment part</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;</CENTER>

<H3>

<I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+2>Pharmacological

approaches</FONT></FONT></I></H3>

<I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>As the chronic nature of

obesity has become clear, clinicians have realized that a long-term

commitment

to obesity treatment is necessary.</FONT>&nbsp;</FONT></I>&nbsp;



<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;The first

investigator

to take this concept seriously was the American researcher Michael

Weintraub,

who in 1992 published the results of treating obese patients with 34

weeks

of combination drug therapy. The two drugs administered (phentermine and

fenfluramine) have different mechanisms of action: adrenergic and

serotoninergic.

Weintraub obtained excellent results by supporting the drug therapy with

a behaviour modification programme, which included detailed advice on

nutrition

and an exercise prescription. The resultant weight loss appeared to be

sustained as long as the drugs were taken.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></I>&nbsp;

<BR><B><FONT SIZE=-1>(This is the notorious "phen-phen" that you can

find

lots of stuff about if you look up fda.gov - Cioff's comment)</FONT></B>

<BR><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Weintraub's work led

to a conceptual shift in obesity management, away from an exclusive

focus

on traditional behaviour modification techniques. The idea has gained

ground

that obesity is an incurable condition like hypertension or diabetes,

for

which the appropriate treatment includes dietary intervention as well as

drug therapy - and in which drug therapy, if instituted, is long-term.

The problem is that the drug armamentarium for treating hypertension and

diabetes is much richer than that for treating obesity. One new drug

designed

for long-term use, dexfenfluramine, has recently come onto the market in

the United States, and has been used in Europe for more than eight

years.

Two other drugs - sibutramine and orlistat - are undergoing clinical

trials

and their manufacturers hope to have them on the market by 1997. All

three

drugs clearly have a greater effect on weight loss than a placebo, but

none is a magic bullet. They are modestly effective in improving the

possibility

of weight loss, and further testing is necessary to determine their

effect

on weight maintenance and on the potential adverse health effects of

obesity.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></I>&nbsp;



<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Pharmaceutical

companies

have large teams at work in an effort to develop new medicines, and it

is likely that more powerful drugs will be marketed in the future as

more

knowledge is gained about food intake regulation and thermogenesis. It

remains to be seen how successful this new era of pharmacology will be,

but it seems clear that the present drugs will only work if they are

part

of a treatment package that includes nutritional and exercise

components.</FONT></FONT></I></TD>

</TR>

</TABLE>

&nbsp;



<P>This looks nice and scientific, doesn't it? The authors talk

disinterestedly

about obesity, disinterestedly about genetics (I've skipped it here; see

for yourself if you like), disinterestedly about lifestyle, and rather

critically about the drugs (two of which were recently withdrawn

recently

because they caused fibrosis of the heart).

<H2>

The crack</H2>

Friends: We are being trapped. At first sight the reader could be

impressed

by the thorough scientificality of these people. You could be easily

spoofed

into believing that GlaxoWellcome, this mighty company with all these

nice

products in their portefolio and their friendly homepage have an honest

approach. Read no further - Just look at the details of the page, and

you

will be a believer in their virtues. Obesity is a health problem. Yes.

The mechanisms are difficult to grasp. Yes. Still much basic research

needs

to be done.&nbsp; Yes. Endless loops of machine code. Only for experts,

really. Nice of them to make a popular version so the common people can

understand. But certainly, with all these efforts, there will sooner or

later be a final solution.



<P>This is the way to put the newbies on the hook. The old cracker and

reverser will take one step back, download the pages, take a pipe and

pack

of matches, and smoke over the text for a while. No hurry. Leaf back and

forth a few times. Make a printout and some squiggles in the margin and

some underlinings of key words. Maybe take a small drink. Glass of wine

or something. Play some music. Slowly the hidden pattern will appear.



<P>It's Zen cracking.



<P>The clue can be found in the concluding paragraphs.



<P>Their concluding message is guarded. They promise little, but show

you

the goals of the game: Just you wait. Let's go on searching for the

cause

of fatness. Sooner or later we'll find the drug that manipulates your

appetite

or your digestion or your metabolism in such a way that you won't need

to get fat if you buy our products. <B>The products of today will

probably

not work alone; you will have to modify your diet and do exercise as

well.</B>

<H2>

Reversing?</H2>

Reality crackers in +ORC's footsteps and Fravia+' site know why people

get fat. It is because we have huge industries that make their money

from

selling junk foods. It is because we have relentless and never sleeping

advertising of those same junk foods. It is because we have huge

industries

selling cars to people, and making cars status, and politicians doing

far

too little for public transportation. It is because we have politicians

who permit workplaces to be placed far away from the places where people

live, so they gotta use motorised transportation, not the bike. It is

beause

we have families so pressed for time that parents have no energy or time

for proper cooking with low-fat low salt fresh ingredients like all that

nice fish (OK, frozen, but anyway) or vegetables or meat. It is because

lots of people have too few meaningful goals to set their lives to, so

they spend their precious evening not in surfing to Fravia+' site, or

reading

good books or interesting newspapers, or knitting, or going to cencerts

or theatres, or helping people who need it, or cooking real food. They

watch commercial TV and drink substandard beers and eat junk.



<P>&nbsp;The cause of fatness is not metabolism or genes or whatever,

but

a sick society that has based its economy on a sick lifestyle.



<P>I heartily agree with +ORC on his supermarket series. But I would

like

to supplement his views: I say that the drug industry is one of the

institutions

that makes the sick system tick. Not only for constructive ends in the

individual patient who really couldn't make it without (like me, for

example),

but for sustaining the system which is destructive to people and to the

planet. For spreading dangerous and useless drugs (the slimming drugs

are

a nice example) that damage individuals and keep people centered on

their

individual metabolic problems instead of the structural disease of the

entire society, of which they themselves are the most pitiful victims.



<P>So I offer to make it my role, in Fravia+' site, to take care of a sort of 

'sublab' on this industry. I'm thinking about an exercise - a reality cracking strainer.

There are lots of nice Web pages from the pharmaceutical industry

around, 

and they are all waiting to be cracked. Good solutions may earn the

author

a question mark ahead of (or inside) her or his name, please write me at

halcioff(at)yahoo(point)com.



<P><I>Ci?off</I>

<HR><I>

Yeah... why not? Time to organize a little the reality cracking lab anyway, isn't it?

And by all means I love the idea to crack some 'official messages' on industrial webpages... may be the whole 

<A href="exegesis.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/exegesis.htm">exegesis</A> techniques could find an application in this context... 

Let's say, to begin with, an 'anti-advertisement' specific area, which I believe is needed, 

and -why not?- a 'food and drugs' area, with Ci?off (that seems to have a specifical interest in this) 

as coordinator, we'll see... other specific areas will follow if needs be... I just wonder 

how many will really work on this kind of stuff...</I>
