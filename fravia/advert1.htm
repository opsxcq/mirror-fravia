<I>Well, a promising reverser, oh my! I don't agree with Pilsner Urquell, though very good,  being better than simple  

Leffe's blonde, <U>geschweige denn</U> superb Grimbergen or splendid Ename: I wonder 

what kind of even superior beers the incredible  

Belgian wizards could produce if they where not continuously bogged down 

(and lobotomyzed) by their idiotic "flemish" or their stupid "walloon" crap... oops, a political 

reversing thought escaped... <BR>anyway I quite agree with 

most of the rest... Enjoy an interesting (and once more: <U>promising</U>) essay!</I>

Dear Fravia+



<P>You asked me to do an essay on advertising. "A sitting duck..." -you said- 

"...bring along the beef". OK, I'll put a cartridge in my multi-barreled

shotgun.

Let's hope the ducks are too busy browsing on the Lemnae (Lemna minor,

I suppose) of

<BR>the lake to take notice of me when I fire.



<P>But they must get a little closer first. My shots are small -designed

for birds- and their range is short. So the aim must be good. Hence the

delay.



<P>I can't guarantee beef in this situation. I could mistake oxen from

cows, but not ducks 8--\ Hopefully what comes out of the hunt will be

some

hard-to-identify mincemeat of sorts. OK, let's call it beef. Beef is OK.

If you make a hamburger, then put it on a slice of Dr Kneipp's

marvellous

bread together with some fried onion and serve it with a glass of real

Czech Pilsener beer. Undoubtedly the best.



<P>After writing the main portion and the main thoughts of this paper I

got to read +ORC's essay for +HCU 1998. I think that one is his best. It

takes me to my entry point of your site, the .pdf cracking, that I found

only weeks after discovering your site, so one of my circles is closed.



<P>In the essay I will, as you requested, take a look at marketing -

hopefully

with little emotion and some analysis. No propaganda, only hard and cold

Ice. I edit this final version with Netscape. I need footnotes in the

document

so that my digressions will not disturb the flow of the text. But you

can't

do that with an ASCII editor 8:--[ Then I gotta use Word, which I

believe common 

netiquette has now explicitly forbidden 8::-[

<BR>&nbsp;

<H1>

PART ONE - MASS ADVERTISING</H1>

This is where the big investment money is, I think. Billions of Euros are

used annually for marketing commodities to the general consumer. Others

have made a better job of describing that than I can ever do&nbsp; - on

this very site - quoting great analysts like McLuhan (the only one I

have

heard of).



<P>Public advertising is relatively easy to identify and see through.

Everybody

recognises it at a glance. But let's try a crack. The real point of

advertising

is



<P>- to make you buy something you don't need, or

<BR>- a particular brand of what you need, or

<BR>- a more expensive variety than you need of a commodity you

definitely

do need.



<P>I will dwell only a little more on the tricks; +ORC has done it well

enough. Read him. I would only add <FONT color=blue>Thorstein B. Veblen</FONT>'s analysis with the

keyword "Conspicuous consumption". There are only a few English links to

be found on Altavista

been 

useful, but I had thought of them anyway)

<P>In very short: There is a great market appeal in goods that makes the

customer look or feel (or believe they are sort of) rich.



<P>Advertising on this level is easy to crack. No need for Zen cracking

here. But

<BR>it is bloody hard to reverse because it is completely open.

<BR>&nbsp;

<H2>

THE HIERARCHY OF ADVERTISING</H2>

The lowest level is the mass-market advertising, which is a nuisance to

everybody. The industries going for the mass market quite frequently

have

rather low profit margins, but huge turnover. I'm sure Kleenex isn't

very

profitable, competing against that recycled paper that I always use

(instead

of that old cloth that smells and that needs washing and is useless for

all other purposes, particularly after I used it to clean up after

frying

onions in olive oil *--).

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>With my meagre knowledge of hacking: Mass advertising is like

hacking

into a system with the ambition of seizing an ordinary user account - to

have the privilege of using the owner's Microsoft Office. Stupid, unless

you are content with little reward for a considerable effort and

expense,

like telephone bills - and high risks of detection.



<P>The cracker goes for the Administrator privileges. The more

sophisticated

industries go for the higher level where each customer represents a

higher

share of the market.

<BR>&nbsp;

<H2>

THE NEXT STEP: THE PROFESSIONAL MARKET</H2>

Selling to or winning a professional is much more rewarding than selling

to or winning a single customer. Perhaps this is most systematically

done

by the pharmaceutical industry towards psysicians. In Europe the

industry

uses perhaps 10.000 Euro (slightly more than US Dollars) per year per 

doctor in various

marketing efforts. Much of this goes to "detailers", well-educated

persons

pressing for visits with doctors, and telling them all the nice things

about their firm's new drug, and maybe some not so nice things about the

competition. These detailpersons are paid according to results, which

are

read from the sales statistics of the pharmacies in their targeted area. There is

a codex of conduct; the detailpersons are not allowed to stray away from

the "label" of the drug. But money doesn't smell, and nothing can be

proven.

The official version is that this marketing is purely scientific. But

you

can see the same tricks: the same beautiful women, the same weeping

children,

the same flowery fields, the same lovely lay-outs, the same free samples

(in much too many countries).

<BR>You may have heard of wining and dining, and expensive travel. It

belongs

to the picture, but has largely gone out of use as a head-on marketing

strategy. But see in the Stealth section!

<BR>&nbsp;

<H2>

THE NEXT STEP: BIG INDUSTRIES AND GOVERNMENTS</H2>

I know only little of direct marketing in this segment. Some is straight

marketing. Some is lobbying.

<BR>Selling fighter planes or big guns to a government is an art of its

own. Afterwards you can read details in the papers. Lockheed, I

remember.

Messerschmitt, I remember. Bofors I remember. There must be lots of them, 

at the moment a 

Dassault/Augusta case is running in Europe as well.



<P>Then for the really interesting part:

<BR>&nbsp;

<H2>

STEALTH ADVERTISING</H2>

The term had a number of different meanings while I was writing this

essay. Now it has settled as advertising disguised as news or hearsay.

You cannot really spot the source; you will need to infer - along the

old

Marxist line of just asking: Who benefits from

this? (The older ones said: <U>cui prodest?</U> :-)



<P>I saith: We have all heard about sildenafil recently. Lots. Every

day.

<BR>You reply: No, not me!



<P>I persist: You have. I have only been witholding the trade name:

Viagra.

(This touches another strategy: the building of trade name identities.

So a generic sildenafil pill will be of no interest to those who burgle

the pharmacies in search of the Sex Pill.)



<P>- Viagra - the sex drug. "Only approved for impotence, not for

healthy

persons - say the drug regulators on the front pages!" Which makes

everybody

believe that it makes a man able to perform better than his normal best

(which must be

<BR>more than a non-medicated man according to Balzac (late 1700), who

made only eleven, plus a dry one, and avoided execution by it). Who pays

the regulators to do this exercise? Is payment in naturals?



<P>- Viagra as THE sex drug for women. Haven't you read it? If it had

been

advertisement, all civilised countries would crack down on an

advertisement

claiming that sildenafil was a sex drug for women. Because there is NO

scientific proof. "The results of clinical trials are promising." This

is purely a rumour, it is a news story with a poorly identified source

- so it is protected by the laws of free speach. But it's a lie at the

present state of scientific development. When will a journalist ask for

the scientific proof?



<P>Again: No scientific proof - because the formal testing has been done

in selected persons with a perceived problem and who have produced

sufficient

physical proof.



<P>But to penetrate society with the marketing: "Viagra blue" has been

launched as a fashion colour for women. Dressed so unsexily that a man

will need a pill? Or is the message "Eat me first?"



<P>And more: The sildenafil exhibited (!) in the Israeli Parliament was

stolen. An exhibition of a drug to be approved by the parliament?

Outrageous.



<P>And this is all news stories. Because Pfizer officially states that

they are worried by all this press. You may believe it if you like,

sucker!



<P>The main product of Pfizer, the manufacturer, is marketing. It has

been

strengthening its American sales force hugely, and have got themselves

a new PR agency recently. They acquire co-marketing projects by showing

potential collaborators their success record in previous projects. (Some

of this information could be read on the Web side of the marketing

analyst

bureau Scott-Levin (www.scottlevin.com). Unfortunately, the page appears

to have been removed. )

<BR>&nbsp;

<H2>

OTHER METHODS OF STEALTH MARKETING:</H2>

"Clinical trials"



<P>The pharmaceutical industry boasts of its high research budgets. Up

to 15 percent of turnover&nbsp; - same as marketing - (and 20 percent

profits).

All this comes from sales.



<P>Now, how do you win the opinion leaders who can do the really

effective

marketing for you? You wine them and dine them. You flatter them by

inviting

them to hold lectures. But most of all you flatter them by admitting

them

into your research and marketing their invaluable contribution. But it

often is reverse research. The answers are all there already. What is

needed

is documentation to persuade the regulators (like the FDA of the US of

A) to approve it (grant marketing authorisation). So they start huge

clinical

trials projects. Thousands of patients may be included. Like the 4s

(4444

Scandinavian patients) for the cholesterol lowering drug simvastatin

(oh,

sorry, Zocor).



<P>This exercise has an international set of rules. For instance you may

within the legal rules discontinue the drug the patient already uses and

put them on yours. And when the trial is over, you will most often have

the State reimbursement system paying for the patients the rest of their

lives, unless another clinical trial comes along.



<P>But if you have a "research project", you can wine and dine the

doctors,

you can pay them for their efforts, you can send them for congresses on

the Maldives or Seychelles or Australia, and you can give out all the

test

medication for free (otherwise strictly forbidden).



<P>This is all legal. No rules against it, at least not in the European

Union, Fravia+ (and +ORC). (BTW: I have noticed the marketeer trick of using

your

name time and again, Fravia+)



<P>But what is the value of this "science"? Most often it is only the

documentation

that the test drug is similar to other well-known drugs on the market.

Who needs another? Only the manufacturer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<H2>

STEALTH MARKETING III.</H2>

Indirect lobbying



<P>You have made a new drug. There are no real competitors. This enables

you to put an outrageous price, say 15 Euro per tablet, on your product.

Nobody will pay. What do you do?



<P>You mobilise the potential users. You sponsor the establishment of

the

headache society, or the osteoporosis society. And then you let the

chairwoman

of the society go to the women of the Health Committee of the Parliament

and persuade them that this drug is witheld from state subsidies because

of sexism in the Ministry of Health.



<P>Guess what happens!



<P>This was the cracking bit. How about reversing?

<BR>&nbsp;

<H2>

REVERSING</H2>





<P>I think we must know our limitations.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>THE MASS MARKET</FONT></B>, I think is beyond reach

if we use the bottom up approach. We can all do our small things, like

bicycling instead of driving a car, not following clothes fashions,

preparing

one's own food instead of buying

<BR>factory-made - and a lot of other (but this makes jobs insecure for

others). In my rather well-to-do neighbourhood people buy a lot of used

clothes and furniture; the poorer areas of the city do less of the sort.

"My baby must have new clothes". As usual the poor ones are the most abused ones... 

some time ago appeared a quite interesting english film about this stuff: "Raining stones".



<P>I perform a private boycott - like Fravia+ - of commercial TV (and most

other TVs as well, come to think of it). It amuses me when the market 

analyst firm interviews

me about the knowledge of current advertising and finally asks me about

my family income, which is more than I deserve. There you lost a good

customer.

But I think the uneducated and/or poor are more helpless victims than I.

And they are the ones that can less afford it, a sad (and cruel) reality.

<BR>&nbsp;

<H3>

Reversal of mass marketing?</H3>

So: How can we reverse the mass marketing? Most criticism is directed

towards

the IO-system (apart from the +HCU boys) or towards the peripherals. But I say: We

must reverse the kernel. First find the name. Then attack it.



<P>The name was identified by old Karl (amazing how many things that guy identified!). 

Profit. Advertising, and

production

of unnecessary goods, is profitable. So we must make the profits from

any undesirable

activity (from our point of view :-) ZERO or NEGATIVE. I can think of some ways of doing that, but

that belongs among the hidden pages of Fravia+' reality

reversing section... 

<BR>&nbsp;

<H3>

Reversal of STEALTH marketing?</H3>

STEALTH advertising can be attacked by simple reversal: Exposure. I have

some ideas about that as well, but -once more- only for the hidden pages... OK, I promise I'll put 

some beef where my mouth is... :-)

<H3>

Finally: When the bottom up approach fails: How about the STEALTH top

down

approach?</H3>

My best example is Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. He was an ardent

anti-socialist.

He used authoritarian methods to suppress socialism in Germany - like anybody else

at that time - <U>but</U> in addition he initiated sick funds, pension funds,

and

some support of the unemployed. This took away much of the sting from the 

foundation

of socialist agitation. Splendid reversal.



<P>He could do this, because nobody would suspect him of being a

socialist.

Similarly, Richard Nixon could open the communication with China because

nobody could accuse him of being a sympathiser with Communism.



<P>So if you really mean it: Keep reasonably quiet - and work yourself

into a position where you can reverse within your field. The effect of

one highly placed reverser will be far more important (and effective) 

than a handful of us "ordinary

people". Imagine it's like in a LeCarr» roman. You work slowly your way to the 

top (slowly!) -helped by the very fact that <U>you</U> know how to reverse the 

hell out of everything that confronts you- and then you act! Man! Minesweeper 

games in the administrations of the EU, UN, Pentagon, KGB, whatever!!



<P>If you don't mean it - if you'r here in order to use these reversing techniques  

just in order to show off, simply to get hold of some attractive

(and hopefully still braless) radical girl - 

then I guess any <U>real</U> reverser will know how to deal with you... you better 

be careful

<BR>&nbsp;
