<P><PRE>SOME PROBLEMS WITH INTEL's INT

The INT instruction is the source of a great deal of the

flexibility in the PC architecture, because the ability to get

and set interrupt vectors means that system services (included

DOS itself) are infinitely extensible, replaceable and

MONITORABLE. Yet the Int instruction is also remarkably

inflexible in two key ways:

-    an interrupt handler DOES NOT KNOW which interrupt number

     invoked it.

-    the int instruction itself expects an IMMEDIATE operand:

     you cannot write MOV AX,x21, and then INT AX; you must

     write INT x21.

That would be very good indeed for us cracker... unfortunately

many high level language compilers compile interrupts into PUSHF

and FAR CALL instruction sequences, rather than do an actual INT.

Another method is to PUSH the address of the handler on the stack

and do RETF to it. 

     Some protection schemes attempt to disguise interrupt calls,

1) camouflaging the code, 2) putting in substitute interrupt

instructions which look harmless and modifying them &quot;on the fly&quot;

or 3) replicating whole interrupt routines inside the code. This

is particularly frequent in the various &quot;disk access&quot; protection

schemes that utilize INT_13 (the &quot;disk&quot; interrupt) and will

therefore be thoroughly explained in -&gt; lesson 5. 



A LITTLE BASIC ASSEMBLER

In order to understand the protection schemes and to defeat them,

you must acquire a passing knowledge of assembler, the &quot;machine

language&quot; code. You can find a lot of good, well explained code

for free: viruses are one of the best sources for good &quot;tight and

tricky&quot; assembler code. You can find the source code of almost

all viruses on the web: oddly all the would be hackers seem to

have an aberrant passion for this kind of stuff instead of

studying cracking techniques. But there are millions of lines of

good explained &quot;commercial&quot; assembler code on the net, just fish

it out and study it: the more you know, the better you crack.

I'll restrict myself to some observations, sprinkled throughout

this tutorial. Let's start with some must_know:

------------------------ STRINGS ----------------------------

The string instructions are quite powerful (and play a great role

in password protection scheme). ALL of them have the property

that:

1)   The source of data is described by the combination DS:SI

2)   The destination of data is described by the combination

     ES:DI

3)   As part of the operation, the SI and/or DI register(s)

     is(are) incremented or decremented so the operation can be

     repeated.

------------------------- JUMPS -----------------------------

JZ   ero       means what it says

JNZ  ero       means what it says

JG   reater    means &quot;if the SIGNED difference is positive&quot;

JA   bove      means &quot;if the UNSIGNED difference is positive&quot;

JL   ess       means &quot;if the SIGNED difference is negative&quot;

JB   elow      means &quot;if the UNSIGNED difference is negative&quot;

JC   arry      assembles the same as JB, it's a matter of

               aesthetic choice



CRACKING PASSWORD PROTECTED PROGRAMS

     Refer to lesson one in order to understand why we are using

games instead of commercial applications as learn material: they

offer the same protection used by the more &quot;serious&quot; applications

(or BBS &amp; servers) although inside files that are small enough

to be cracked without loosing too much time.

     A whole series of programs employ copy protection schemes

based upon the possess of the original manual or instructions.

That's obviously not a very big protection -per se- coz everybody

nowadays has access to a photocopier, but it's bothering enough

to motivate our cracks and -besides- you'll find the same schemes

lurking in many other password protected programs. 

     Usually, at the beginning of the program, a &quot;nag screen&quot;

requires a word that the user can find somewhere inside the

original manual, something like: &quot;please type in the first word

of line 3 of point 3.3.2&quot;. Often, in order to avoid mistakes, the

program indicates the first letter of the password... the user

must therefore only fill the remaining letters.



Some examples, some cracks:

---------------------------------------------------

UMS (Universal Military Simulator) version 1

by Dr Ezra SIDRAN

(c) 1987 Intergalactic Development

European Union:     Rainbird Software

United States:      Firebird Software

---------------------------------------------------

     This very old EGA program is one of the first I cracked in

my youth, and it's very interesting coz it employs a very basilar

protection scheme (a &quot;PRIMITIVE&quot;! More than 80% of the protection

schemes used to day (January 1996) are directly derived from one

of the 12 primitives.

     The nag screen snaps at the beginning and keeps indefinitely

asking your answer, only the use of CTRL+C will bring you out of

it, back to DOS. That's a clear sign of older protection schemes:

newer schemes let you in for only 3 attempts or even only one,

and pop out to the OS if you fail. In UMS, besides, there is no

&quot;first letter&quot; aid, a later improvement.

     The cracking procedure for password protected programs is,

first of all, to find out where are stored the letters that you

type in. So examine your memory map, find out where the program

dwells in memory, do a snap save of these memory areas and a

series of snap compares as you type your password in.

     Strangely enough, in the case of UMS, as you type your

password there seems to be no difference at all in the memory

locations where this program dwells... yet the data must be

somewhere... Usually such a situation is a clear sign that an

hooked interrupt is used to hide the data.

     Checking the hooked vectors you find out the following:

vecs 00, 02, 22          are hooked where needs be

vecs 34-3D               are hooked at xxxx:0

vec  3E                  is hooked at xxxx:00CA

     Ha! Let's have a closer look at this bizarre 3E hook. Let's

search for some words used in the nag_screen and then let's dump

the area where we find them (in UMS that will be at 3E_hook

address + 7656) and loo! You'll see the content of the nag screen

and, immediately afterwards, ALL the passwords &quot;in extenso&quot;, i.e.

not encoded, not scrambled, nothing at all... THERE THEY ARE

(that's a very old protection scheme indeed). You could now, for

instance, easily patch all the different passwords to (for

instance) &quot;PASS&quot;, and this would work... it's a very primitive

protection, as we said, nevertheless the use of a hooked vector

as hiding place for the protection code is not yet obsolete...

we'll find it elsewhere, in many &quot;more modern&quot; programs.

     Now let's go deeper and examine the &quot;compare&quot; mechanism, we

want to crack, here, not just to patch.

     Password protected programs (and access protection routines

for server and BBS, for that matter) have quite a lot of weak

points. The most obvious one (you 'll find out the other when

you'll high crack) is that they MUST compare the password of the

user with the original one(s). So you do not need to steal a

password, you just need to &quot;ear&quot; the echo of the original one in

the memory locations used for the compare, or, and that's more

correct, to crack the compare mechanism itself so as to make it

let you in even with a totally false password.

     The compare mechanism of UMS can be found setting a

breakpoint on the memory range that covers the three locations

where the password is stored (and you 'll find these with your

search capabilities and with a pair of snap compares):

ES:0F8E   (here you 'll see a copy of the password that the

          program is asking)

ES:0F5C   (here you 'll see a copy of the password that the user

          types in)

INT_3E hook_address + 7656 (here are all the possible passwords

          in extenso).



Here is how the protection scheme looks out:



MOV       CX,FFFF        Charge MAX in CX

REPNZ     SCASB          Scan ES:DI (the user password)

NOT       CX             Now CX holds the number of the

                         character that the user typed in

MOV       DI,SI          Real password offset to DI

LDS       SI,[BP+0A]     User password offset in SI

REPZ      CMPSB          Compares DS:SI with ES:DI (user

                         password and real password) then snap

                         out at CX=0 or at char_different,

                         whichever comes first.

Nice, we found the compare schema... how do we crack it now?

There are many elegant solutions, but let's remain on a basic

level... you look at the code that follows the CMPSB searching

the &quot;snapping schema&quot;... here it is immediately afterwards

(that's the case in most of the primitives). Remember: we sprung

out of the CMPSB check at the first different char, OR at the end

of the count of the user chars. Here it is what follows:

     MOV  AL,[SI-01]     loads in AL the before_different char

                         of the user password (should be zero)

     SUB  AL,ES:[DI-01]  subs with the before_different char of

                         the real password (should be zero)

     CBW                 zero flag set, &quot;TRUE&quot;, if OK_match

Well let's now look for the next JZ near (it's a &quot;74&quot; code)

     CS:IP 740D     JZ  location no_good

Wait, let's continue a little... is there another check (often

you have a double check on DI)... yes there is!

     CS:IP 7590     JNZ location no_good

Cracking such a schema is very easy: you just need to substitute

75 to 74 and 74 to 75: transform your JZ in a JNZ and the JNZ in

a JZ... now you will always pass, no matter what you write,

unless you exactly guess the password!



Now let's quickly crack it:

------------------------------------------------

CRACKING UMS.EXE (by +ORC, January 1996)



ren ums.exe ums.ded

symdeb ums.ded

-    s (cs+0000):0 Lffff 74 0D 1E B8 C2 3F

-    s (cs+1000):0 Lffff 74 0D 1E B8 C2 3F

-    e xxxx:yyyy+17 74

-    w

-    q

ren ums.ded ums.exe

-------------------------------------------------



     In the debug/symdeb crack above we use as search string the

bytes comprising and following immediately the first JZ.

I know, I know... we saw them in [Soft-ice] and we could have

modified them there, but I'm teaching also pupils who may not

have [Soft-ice]. 

     Note that the program is x431A0 bytes long, and therefore

has a BX=4 sectors adding to the CX=31A0 in the initial

registers... that's the reason I wanted to examine all the

sectors (even if I knew that the snap was in sector (cs+2000):

that's good practice! If you do not find your string in the first

sector you must search for it in the next sectors, till you find

it, coz in many programs there may be MORE THAN ONE repetitions

of the same schema (more about this double check later).

That's it, pupils, that's the way to crack old [UMS.EXE].



Let's go over, now, to more elaborate and more modern password

protection schemes.



--------------------------------------------------------

LIGHTSPEED, from Microprose (we crack here version 461.01)

--------------------------------------------------------

     This program, released in 1990, operates a more &quot;modern&quot;

variation of the previous scheme. You 'll find this variation in

many access routines of remote servers (and this makes it very

interesting indeed).

     Let's begin as usual, with our hooked vectors examination

and our snap compares.

Hooked vectors: 00, 08, 1B, 22, 23: nothing particular.

The snap_comparisons of the main memory area -as you type the

password in- gives more than six pages of changing locations...

that's clearly much too much to examine.

What now?

     Sit down, have a Martini Wodka (I'm afraid that only

Moskovskaja 'll do) and meditate. Get the memory map of the

program's layout. Start anew: snap_save (before typing anything

in). Type as password &quot;ABCDE&quot;. Get the print of the snap

compares. Sit down, sip Martini Wodka, relax. You know that the

code for A is x41, for B x42, for C x43 and so on... and in the

snap_compares, that you made between letters, you 'll have only

some locations with these values changing. Focus on these. 

     You 'll soon enough find out that for LIGHTSPEED absolute

location (in my computer) 404307, i.e.: relative locations (in

my computer) 30BE:F857 or 4043:0007 evoke the characters you

type, i.e. something like 

-----------------------------------------------------

F855 F856 F857                F858                F859...

41   3E   first_ready_letter  your_1st_letter     your_2nd_one...

-----------------------------------------------------

Inspecting the same prints, you 'll find out that absolute

location 30C64 (imc) or relative location 30BE:F83E evokes the

LAST character you typed in. The relative code line is:

     CS:0097   MOV  AX,[BP-08] where SS:F83E = 00+letter_code

     Now breakpoint at these locations and investigate what's

going on (for instance, the instruction that follows is 

     CS:009A   MOV [BX], AX 

and this means that the code of the letter you just typed in will

be now copied in BX=F85A. What else can you do? Time to use a

little intuition: look for an instruction &quot;CMP AX,000D&quot;, which

is the typical &quot;IF the user hits ENTER then&quot; instruction, coz

&quot;x1D&quot; its the ENTER keystroke. This must be somewhere around

here. Ha! You 'll soon enough find the line

     CS:0073  3D0D00     CMP AX,000D

And now the way is open to the crack. But YOU DO NOT NEED ALL

THIS! Since the password protection schemes are -as I told you-

all more or less the same, I would suggest that you use first of

all following trick: in the largest part of the program (use

memory map to see where the program dwells) search the &quot;F3A6&quot;

sequence, that's instruction REPZ CMPSB.

     In the case of Lightspd you 'll get as answer FOUR addresses

with this instruction: (pgsg=program main segment)

     pgsg:C6F9

     pgsg:E5CA

     pgsg:E63E

     pgsg:EAB0

There you are! Only four... have a short look at each of them:

you 'll see that the second one (pgsg:E5CA) is the &quot;good&quot; one.

The compare mechanism in this program of 1990 it's more or less

the same as in 1987'UMS (and do believe me: the same mechanism

is still in use to day (1996)!

B9FFFF    MOV       CX,FFFF   charge Max in CX

F2AE      REPNZ     SCASB     this scans ES:DI (the original

                              password)

F7D1      NOT       CX        so many chars in the original pw

2BF9      SUB       DI,CX     change DI for compare

F3A6      REPZ      CMPSB     compares DS:SI with ES:DI (real

                              pw with user pw) then snaps out

                              at CX=0 or at char_differs

     See how easy? They all use the same old tricks the lazy

bastards! Here the section is preceded by a small routine to

lowercase the user password, coz the original muster is always

lowercased.

     Now you would like, may be, to breakpoint at one of these

locations, in order to stop the program &quot;in the snap area&quot; and

inspect the snap mechanism... that WILL NOT DO with a &quot;fixed&quot;

breakpoint, coz these locations are called by the snap with a

different segment:offset numeration as the one you found (that's

old dos magic). So you MUST first set a memory_read/write

breakpoint on these locations, and then get at them at the snap.

Now you can find out the segment:offset used by the snap and only

now you'll be able to set a fixed breakpoint (for instance on the

NOT CX instruction).

     Now run the program and breakpoint in: have a dump of the

ES:DI and see the original password. How nice! We have now the

original password in extenso in our memory dump window. That's

the &quot;echo&quot;. By the way, there is a whole school of cracking

devoted to find and use these echoes... we work on different

paths, nevertheless password fishing can be interesting: where

are the password stored? From which locations do they come from?

A common practice of the protectionists is to hide them in

different files, far away, or in hooked vectors, or in SMC parts.

This is a program of 1990, that differs in respect to UMS: the

passwords are not &quot;hidden&quot; inside a hooked vector, coz that's a

pretty stupid protection: any hexdump utility would still permit

you to see them. Here the passwords are encoded (albeit in a very

primitive manner): looking for them (with memory range

breakpoints) you'll quickly find a section of the program code

that looks like this:

sg:0118   8C 91 9D 95 9B 8D 00 B8 EC 94 9B 8D 8F 8B 9B

sg:0128   94 9B 8D 00 AE EC 9C 9B 8A 9B 86 00 A9 EC 91

This is a typical encoded matrix, with clear 00 fences between

the encoded passwords.

Ha! If all codes where so easy to crack! This is no better than

children's crypt! It's a NEG matrix! And there is direct

correspondence: 91=6F=&quot;o&quot;; 92=6E=&quot;n&quot;; 93=6D=&quot;m&quot; and so on... Ha!

     Let's now leave the &quot;hidden&quot; passwords and proceed with our

cracking... let's follow the snap procedure after the REPZ CMPSB

instruction looking for the &quot;jump to OK&quot; instruction...

F3A6      REPZ      CMPSB          ; compares DS:SI with ES:DI 

7405      JZ   preserved_AX=0000   &lt;--- Here the first JZ

1BC0      SBB  AX,AX

ADFFFF    SBB  AX,FFFF   

:preserved_AX=0000

8BF3      MOV  SI,BX

8BFA      MOV  DI,DX

5D        POP  BP

CB        RETF

....

83C404    ADD  SP,+04

0BC0      OR   AX,AX

7509      JNZ  0276                &lt;------ And here it is!

     Now, remembering the UMS crack, you would probably want to

change the JZ instruction in a JNZ instruction (you tried it on

the fly INSIDE  [Soft-Ice] and it did work!), the &quot;74&quot; with a

&quot;75&quot; also. And then you would like to change the JNZ instruction

in a JZ instruction... Please feel free to try it... it will NOT

work! (You will not even find the second JNZ in the program

code). You should always be aware of the SMC (self modifying

code) protections: parts of the code my be decrypted &quot;on the

fly&quot;, as needs arise, by the program. The code you modify while

the program is running may be different from the code of the

&quot;dead&quot; program.

     Here we have a small &quot;improvement&quot; of the primitive: the

same instruction is used as &quot;muster&quot; for manipulation of other

parts of the program... if you do change it in a JNZ you get an

overlay message and the program pops out with instability! You

cannot easily modify the JNZ instruction either, coz the part

after the RETF will be compiled &quot;on the fly&quot; by lightspeed, and

you would therefore have to search the decryption mechanism and

modify the original encrypted byte somewhere... and may be they

do encrypt it twice... and then you must hack all night long...

very annoying.

     So do the following: back to the snap, a sip of martini-

Wodka and meditate: loo! The only thing that happens after the

JZ, is the setting of the AX register to flag *FALSE* (AX=1...

that's what the two SBB instructions do) if the snap went out

with a non-zero flag... i.e. if you did not know the password.

So let's nop the 5 bytes of the two SBB instructions, or, more

elegantly, let's have a INC AX, DEC AX, NOP, INC AX, DEC AX

sequence instead of the two SBB! There is a good reason to use

a sequence of working instructions instead of a series of NOPs:

recent protection schemes &quot;smell&quot; patched nops inside the program

and trash everything if they find more than -say- three

consecutive NOPs! You should always try to choose THE LESS

INTRUSIVE and MORE &quot;CAMOUFLAGED&quot; solution when you crack!

     Eliminating the two SBBs we get our crack! No need to bother

with the second JNZ either... the program will work as if you got

the password if you have it AND if you do not (that's better as

the previous type of crack -seen for UMS- when you crack computer

accesses: hereby the legitimate user will not have any suspects

'coz the system will not shut him out... everybody will access:

the good guys and the bad ones... that's nice isn't it?).



     Now let's quickly crack LIGHTSPD:

------------------------------------------------

-    q

ren lightspd.ded lightspd.exe

-------------------------------------------------



All this CMPSB is very common. Some programs, nevertheless,

utilize a password protection scheme that is slightly different,

and does not rely on a F3A6 REPZ CMPSB instruction. Let's

analyze, for instance, the protection scheme used in the first

version of Perfect general I from QQP-White wolf, July 1992.

When you break in, at the nag screen, you are in the middle of

the BIOS procedures, coz the program expects your input (your

password, that's is). You 'll quickly find out (MAP MEMORY

USAGE!) that [General.exe] dwells in two main areas; Setting

breakpoints on memory write you 'll find out that the memory area

&quot;queried&quot; by the protection mechanism is

     xxxx:1180 to xxxx:11C0

where xxxx represents the second of the memory segments where the

program dwells. Now do the following (a very common cracking

procedure):

*    Breakpoint on memory range WRITE for the small memory area

     touched by the program in querying you for the password.

*    Breakpoint TRACE on the whole memory range of the MAIN

     CODE.

*    Run anew everything

It's already done! Now it's your intuition that should work a

little: Here the last 9 traces (traces [!], not instructions

following on a line) before the calling of the procedure sniffing

your memory area:



-9   xxxx:0185 7425           JZ   somewhere, not taken

-8   xxxx:0187 2D1103         SUB  AX,0311

-7   xxxx:018A 7430           JZ   somewhere, not taken

-6   xxxx:018C 2DFD04         SUB  AX,04FD

-5   xxxx:018F 7443           JZ   next_trace, taken

-4   xxxx:01D4 E85500         CALL funny_procedure 

-3   xxxx:022C 803E8F8C11     CMP  BYTE PTR[8C8F],11

-2   xxxx:0231 750E           JNZ  somewhere, not taken

-1   xxxx:0233 9A0A0AC33E     CALL procedure_that_sniffs

                                   our_memory_area



Well, the call to funny_procedure followed by a byte compare

&quot;feels&quot; fishy from very far away, so let's immediately look at

this part of the code of [General.exe]

:funny_procedure

     803E8F8C11     CMP  BYTE PTR[8C8F],11

     750E           JNZ  compare_byte

     9A0A0AC333     CALL procedure_that_sniffs

     0AC0           OR   AL,AL

     7405           J2   compare_byte

     C6068F8C2A     MOV  BYTE PTR [8C8F],2A

:compare_byte

     803E8F8C2A     CMP  BYTE PTR [8C8F],2A

     7504           JNZ  after_ret

     B001           MOV  AL,01

     C3             RET  

You should be enough crack-able ;=), by this lesson, to notice

immediately the inconsistency of the two successive instructions

MOV 2A and CMP 2A, coz there would be no sense in comparing the

&quot;2A&quot; in order to JNZ to after_ret if you just had the 2A set with

the precedent MOV instruction... but the first JNZ jumps to the

compare WITHOUT putting the &quot;2A&quot; inside. And &quot;2A&quot; is nothing else

as the &quot;*&quot; symbol, commonly used by programmer as &quot;OK&quot;! This

protection works in the following way (this is the above code

explained):

-    compare holy_location with 11

-    jump non zero to compare holy_loc with &quot;*&quot;

-    else call sniffing protection part

-    or al,al (al must be zero, else)

-    jump zero to compare holy_loc with &quot;*&quot;

-    if al was zero mov &quot;*&quot; inside holy_loc

-    compare holy_loc with &quot;*&quot;

-    if there is a difference then JNZ beggar_off_ugly_copier

-    else ret_ahead_nice_buyer



Now let's quickly crack it:

CRACKING GENERAL.EXE (by +ORC, January 1996)



ren general.exe general.ded

symdeb general.ded

-    s (cs+0000):0 Lffff 8C 11 75 0E

xxxx:yyyy           (this is the answer of the debugger)

-    e xxxx:yyyy+2  EB [SPACE] 09 

-    w

-    q

ren general.ded general.exe

-------------------------------------------------

And in this way you changed the JNZ to the cmp &quot;*&quot; instruction

in a JMP to the mov &quot;*&quot; instruction. So no more nag screens, no

more protections... serene, placid, untroubled [general.exe].



Well, that's it for this lesson, reader. Not all lessons of my

tutorial are on the Web.

     You 'll obtain the missing lessons IF AND ONLY IF you mail

me back (via anon.penet.fi) with some tricks of the trade I may

not know that YOU discovered. Mostly I'll actually know them

already, but if they are really new you'll be given full credit,

and even if they are not, should I judge that you &quot;rediscovered&quot;

them with your work, or that you actually did good work on them,

I'll send you the remaining lessons nevertheless. Your

suggestions and critics on the whole crap I wrote are also

welcomed.
