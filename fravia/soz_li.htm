Well, oh my... another great reverser steps out of the shadows of the web...  

in fact .sozni seems to have gone a long way all on his own. Visit his very 

good site at <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.vnam.com/sozni/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.vnam.com/sozni/'" tppabs="http://www.vnam.com/sozni/">http://www.vnam.com/sozni</A> 

and you'll find a WEALTH of extremely interesting essays about OCX controls (but not only).<BR>

I have decided to reproduce one of them, because I found it particularly interesting 

and because 

I'm sure that it will work as a 'portal' to .sozni's good site. If you are interested 

in OCX cracking, you may find interesting also  Popjack's essay about <A href="popja_51.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/popja_51.htm">OCX Control Highlights and

<H2>Using .LIC files</H2>



<P>Hopefully you are all by now seeing how weak ActiveX licensing really is. I have been

focusing on Registry licenses up to this point but that's just one method. To protect

ActiveX controls, the software will use one of these methods: 



<OL>

  <LI>Using the standard Microsoft registry licensing method </LI>

  <LI>Using a custom registry licensing method </LI>

  <LI>Using standard .Lic files </LI>

  <LI>Using custom .Lic files </LI>

  <LI>Compiling separate demo and real .OCX files </LI>

</OL>



<P>Note: Although the last one is a protection method, the real .OCX must use one of the

other four methods. I have talked about these a little and will cover them more in the

future. </P>



<P>I have already explained how to crack method #1 in my previous messages I hope you have

all tried doing this by now. If not, download the real version of Janus GridEx (not the

demo) and try to create a .reg file for it. </P>



<P>Methods #2 and #4 aren't unique to ActiveX controls. If a control uses one of these

methods, you just have to crack them using your general cracking skills (that you can

learn somewhere else). </P>



<P>So that leaves method #3, using standard .Lic files. </P>



<P>Remember that in order for an ActiveX control to be registered, it needs to be provided

a license string. In the development environment (such as VB) an instance of the control

is created but a null is passed instead of a license string. That tells the control that

it needs to look on the developer's computer to find its own license string. Sometimes it

looks at the registry and sometimes it looks for a .Lic file. </P>



<P>Usually when I first try out a control, I have RegMon and FileMon running (filtered, of

course). It is usually obvious which licensing method it is using. It is probably going to

look at HKCR\Licenses in the registry or &lt;control&gt;.lic on disk. If I see no activity

at all, then I assume I have a compiled demo and go back to their web site to find the

real thing. </P>



<P>If a control is looking for a .lic file, then it is usually using the standard .lic

file licensing scheme. This is the method that has been most used in the past (starting

with VBX's). Most often the control will just look at the first line of the .Lic file and

return that as the license string. Sometimes it will look for some other string (such as a

serial #) or check the length of the file. It is rare that a control will use a custom

method (such as an encrypted .lic file). </P>



<P>Often, a demo control will be distributed with a demo .lic file so the .lic file might

already be there. FileMon will tell you if one was found or not. It is most likely located

in the same directory as the .OCX file and uses that same name with a .lic extension. For

example, dcube.ocx uses a file named dcube.lic. </P>



<P>If you find a license file, open it up in a text editor and see what's there. Usually

you will see a copyright string and then a paragraph on how it is bad to share these .lic

files with your friends. If you open the file and get binary data, then you are looking at

a custom .lic file and must use a different method than explained here to crack the

control. </P>



<P>If you can't find a .lic file, create one using Notepad and just put anything you want

on the first line. Just make sure the file has the same name (except the extension) and is

in the same place as the .OCX file. </P>



<P>So right now if you create an instance of that control it will look at the .lic file,

get the first line, compare that to another string, and since they don't match pop up a

nag screen or something. </P>



<P>All we have to do is make that first line in the .lic file contain the correct string

and we have a registered control. </P>



<P>So where do we get the correct string? There are many ways we can do that. Most

controls are very easy but sometimes you have to fish a little. Here's how it's done: </P>



<P><STRONG>USING PEEK OR HEX EDITOR</STRONG> - Most of the time the string is compiled

right into the OCX as plaintext that is easily extracted using Peek or a Hex Editor. Peek

sometimes cuts off part of the string so I prefer UtlraEdit. Depending on how the control

was developed, the string will be found in different places. However, I have noticed that

it is usually a Unicode string and it is usually a copyright notice. If I have trouble

finding it, I use Peek to locate it and then UtlraEdit to verify it. </P>



<P><STRONG>USING A DECOMPILER OR RESOURCE EDITOR</STRONG> - I rarely need to do this but

sometimes it is hard to locate or there are lots of candidates and you need to find the

correct one. Of course, if the string is encryted or created at runtime, then you will

probably need this method to see what's going on. But you may be better off using a

debugger. </P>



<P><STRONG>USING SOFTICE - </STRONG>If the string isn't stored in plaintext in the OCX

file, you will actually have to do some work. Softice works very well with ActiveX

controls because there are a lot of triggers we can use. Here are some breakpoints (in

order of preference) that usually work: lstrcmp lstrcmpi comparestring msvcrt!strcmp

lstrcpy readfile lstrlen createdialog </P>



<P>If you can't find the right one, look what functions the OCX file is importing. If you

haven't found the string by now, you may have a compiled demo or they are not using a

standard .lic file. </P>



<P>By the way, PopJack has written a good essay on using SoftIce to crack OCX controls. </P>



<P><STRONG>USING AN EXE</STRONG> - As I have explained before, the control's license

string is compiled right into an executable. That way the executable can provide the

string where a client doesn't have the .lic file. Just open the EXE in a Hex Editor and

look for the control's class name. Right above the class name you will see the license

string. Put that string into the .lic file and you are registered. Many times you can

download a compiled (on their registered computers) demo EXE that can be used to extract

license strings. </P>



<P><STRONG>USING OTHER LICENSES </STRONG>- If you already have one registered control from

a company, you can often rename that same license and use it with other controls they

make. Most of the DameWare licenses I have created are just copies of the same .lic file.

Just use the same name as the OCX and put it in the same location. </P>



<P><STRONG>USING A SERIAL NUMBER </STRONG>- Sometimes you have a serial number you found

on the net but it is registered to someone like &quot;^KiLLer^CraCKeR666!&quot; Now we

don't want software registered to some 13-year-old and we certainly don't want this name

appearing on our software prototypes (NOTE: I don't buy the control until a project is

done and I know it doesn't suck). </P>



<P>Or maybe your friend gave you his serial and you want to share it with others. But you

don't want to get him in trouble because he already sent in his registration card with

that number. </P>



<P>So what we do is install the control using this serial number and let the software do

its thing and create its license files. Then save the license file and uninstall the

software. Put the license file back where it was then reinstall the software. This time it

thinks it is an upgrade or reinstall and you can use your own name. And you can now give

the .lic files to others to do the same. </P>



<P><STRONG>WEB OR FTP</STRONG> - Although rare, every once in a while I can search the web

and find a .lic file. And sometimes on the vendor's web site I come across something

useful (more on this later). If all else fails, you can try this out. </P>



<P>One notable experience I had was when cracking VB Advantage. Their .lic file was a

binary file. After digging around a bit, I found that they used a commercial protection

DLL. I went to this company's web site and found their help file, tech notes, and even a

demo of their software (with a license editor!). </P>



<P>And that's about it. For some reason very few people crack ActiveX controls. But as you

can see, they are much easier and quicker to crack than most applications. If you want to

play around with these concepts, try cracking controls from DameWare or DataDynamics. </P>
