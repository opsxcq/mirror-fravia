<CENTER>
This page's main aim is to show you what I do know about you, I mean, about 
the people 
visiting the servers where I'm hosted. All this stuff is obvious for those 
among us that use own-made or ready-made trackers, pretty amazing for those 
among us (like I myself was some years ago) that don't know all the following 
possibilities. As you'll see, you better travel anonimously... else you are 
a sitting duck.<BR><BR>Strange as it may seem to people not already knowing all 
this (and unfortunately many do not), I know (with some interesting exceptions) 
who you are, from which site you come from, how long you have been there, 
which urls on my site you are interested in, where and what and through which 
specific URLs of mine you are moving. Looking at my stats I may decide to 
track your IP, or to track all those accessing a specific URL (this is 
the way I found out which people, and from where, have accessed my 
advanced stego page, btw). I could then block your specific IP 
from accessing 
all my site, or a part of it (I have never done it) or I may just choose to 
have a close 'watch' set on your IP, just in order to see what the cuckoo 
you are doing in my site, or where you are going when you leave it (amazing 
how many people have started searching Altavista for Lempicka after having 
had a look at my <A href="stego.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/stego.htm">stego.htm</A> page :-)<BR>Of course, as 
you'll learn elsewhere on my site, anybody 
nowadays has at least half a dozen different IPs, yet the lure 
is always the same and works as in the old trap: people interested in 
specific matters will try to access 
them in a hurry, no-matter the risk!</CENTER>
<HR size=3><CENTER>
As you'll see below, our tracking systems grow and develop quite a lot. I have 
divided the 'findings' in phases (chronologically) and you'll see how much 
I knew about you a couple of years ago, how much I knew last year and how 
much I know now (much too much... I'm wasting a lot of time looking at my 
stats! :-(

<CENTER><I>Dear internaut, unfortunately all the data you have been 
disseminating around 
have been collected and used to get your exact profile... this is 
happening everywhere on the planet, not only on the Web: 
Cyberocracy, as some call it, 
is getting nearer and nearer... they trace us every time we use 
credit cards, every time you 
buy in a supermarket with the so called "advantage" cards 
(why do you think they give 
them out and ask you to use them, duh?), every time you make 
a search or simply 
visit places on the
web, or email somebody, or access (or email) a usenet group. 
This page will try to explain the problems and hint 
to some counter measure 
you would be well advised to take. First of all Have a look at what 
I knew in 1996 about 
the people 
hitting my page (5th of November 1996: my dutch spider on Geocities)<BR>

 Yes, here we come to the 'very actual' situation. Basically, I can do with 
my visiting guests whatever I will (with some VERY inetersting exceptions). 
Here you have the people on line at the same moment (live users) on one of 
my main sites <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=13 ALT= red><A href="whoson.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/whoson.htm">a couple of days ago</A>:

Now have a look at the instructions for tracking guests (this will scare you 
to death, I know, yet get acquainted with it... any  
server and any stupid server administrator can use this kind of 
facilities, my little w¸rstchen):</I></CENTER><PRE><FONT color=purple>Watches 
   Watches perform two functions. 

   1) Watches are used to track how often a particular URL, CGI gateway or 
   resource on the Web Server is accessed. The IP Address of every user who 
   accesses the resource is logged. 

   2) Watches can also watch any IP Address or range of IP Addresses that 
   visit the Server. The complete session of any user(s) from that IP are 
   logged. 

   Watches are viewed and managed using the following two options. 

     Watch
     Results
       A list of all configured Watches is displayed, showing how many 
       times they have been Hit as well as the number of days since they 
       were initiated. Details for any watch can be viewed by clicking 
       the Magnifying Glass adjacent to it. 
     Watch
     Admin
       The Watch Admin option is used to administrate Watches. It is used 
       to Create, Edit, Delete and Empty watches. Typically this tab is 
       only available to Administrators and requires a password to be 
       used.

    Refresh Button
       The Refresh button forces a new Watches page to be generated. The 
       report will be updated, accurate up to the moment the page is 
       generated.

      Printing Reports
   1) Select the Print button located at the top of the Watches page. 
      This will generate a new Web page formatted for printing without 
      buttons or page controls. 

   2) Use your Web Browser Print command to send the print job to your 
      printer. 

   3) Use your Web Browser Back button to exit the printable Web page.

      Watch Results
   All Watches are accessible by selecting the Watch Listing option. 

     Magnifying
     Glass
       A detailed log for any watch can be viewed by clicking the Magnifying 
       Glass adjacent to it. A Watch History Web Page is generated displaying 
       the log file. 

   To print the Watch History Web Page: 

       1) Select the Print button located at the top of the Watch History page. 
          This will generate a new Web page formatted for printing without 
          buttons or page controls. 

       2) Use your Web Browser Print command to send the print job to your 
          printer.

       3) Use your Web Browser Back button to exit the printable Web page. 

     Watch Name
         The Watch Name assigned to the Watch when it was created using the
         Watch Admin option. The URL or IP Address being watched is displayed
         below the Watch Name. 
     Hits
         The number of times the Watch has been triggered. In the case of a 
         URL Watch, this means the URL being watched has been Hit. In the case 
         of an IP Watch, this means the Web Site has been visited (Hit).
     Days 
         The number of Days since the Watch was created.

      Watch Admin
   The Watch Admin option is used to administrate Watches. It is used to Create, 
   Edit, Delete and Empty watches. 

   Note: On many Web Sites this tab is only available to Administrators and is 
   protected accordingly using NT Security. If you are unable to view the Watch 
   Administration interface, this is likely the reason. 

   The following Administration Features are available by selecting the Watch 
   Admin option: 

     New
     Watch
       Select the New button to create a new Watch. 

       1) Type    Select URL Watch or IP Watch from the select box. URL Watches 
          are used to track a particular URL, CGI gateway or resource on a 
          Virtual Server. IP Watches are used to watch any user IP address or 
          range of IP addresses that visit the Web Site.</FONT></PRE><CENTER>
<I>You can easily understand how a combination of the two watches decsribed above has 
easily allowed 
me to find out some time ago who where some undesiderable "IMF" visitors, where 
they roamed and where from and where to they came and 
left :-)</I></CENTER><PRE><FONT color=purple>       2) Title   The descriptive name you define for the watch. 
       3) Watch For   The full URL or IP Address to watch. 
           To watch a single IP Address a fully defined IP address such as 
           199.71.150.60 is required. To watch a Range of IP Addresses a 
           partially defined IP address such as 199.71.150.* is required. 
           In this example any hosts in the 199.71.150 network would be 
           included in the watch. 

      Some examples of URL Watches follow: 

    DOS path to the HTML file:    c:\somesubdir\wwwroot\default.htm   
    Relative URL is
              typed as follows:    / 

    DOS path to the HTML file:   c:\somesubdir\wwwroot\thanks.htm    
    Relative URL is
              typed as follows: /thanks.htm 

    URL Watch for a Executable File.    
    DOS path to the executable file:   
              c:\somesubdir\wwwroot\files\sample.exe   
    Relative URL is typed as follows:
              /files/sample.exe 

    URL Watch for a CGI Gateway.    
    The database shown here is called using the question mark (?) CGI 
    operator with the open (o_products) parameter.    
    Relative URL
              is typed as follows:    /database/db.dll?o_products 

    4) Options   Keep Detailed Log. If checked, a detailed Log is kept 
       showing every request for the URL. If not checked, no log is kept, 
       however Totals are still tabulated and Days are counted.   
       Suspend Watching. If checked, watching is suspended, no log is kept, 
       Totals are not tabulated and Days are not counted. 

   5) Use the Submit Watch button to submit the completed Watch. Use the Back
      button to exit without submitting the Watch. 

     Edit
     Watch
      Use the Edit button adjacent to the Watch Name to make changes to an  
      existing Watch. 
     Delete
     Watch
      Use the Delete button adjacent to the Watch Name to completely remove a 
      Watch including the log file for the Watch. 
     Empty
     Watch
      Use the Empty button adjacent to the Watch Name to empty (delete) the 
      contents of the Watch Log.</FONT></PRE><HR size=3> <CENTER>
Amazing, isn't it? Now take a minute and think about this kind 
of Web-tracking: if I can trace 
you so
