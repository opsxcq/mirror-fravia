<HR>SLH's fourth paper<BR>Software warriors through the warp</FONT><HR>

</CENTER>

<FONT color=purple>"With a library of procedures of this type in 

whatever category of components

 are seen as useful by the programmer, production suddenly rises very

 dramatically. Now some may ask, isn't this what RAD systems are for, just

 draw up the interface with a mouse and you don't have to do all this hard

 coding ?</P><P>



 The answer is that the programmer who has done the hard yards will have the

 interface up and going in the time it takes the RAD operator to pick their

 way through the property list with a mouse.</P><P>



 This is the difference between rapid <U>front end</U> development, bloat and all,

 and rapid <U>application</U> development based on good quality low level code. The

 programmer who bothers to write their own "objects" can throw them around at

 a rate that will make RAD operators go looking for their handbook."</FONT>

<I>SLH is back again with another (the fourth) of his small masterpieces: You would be well advised to read 

all the preceding parts: it's a concentrated <U>very good</U> 

course about the UTMOST IMPORTANCE of assembling 

in everyday windows (or whatever) programming. This will help you in order to better understand 

the purposes (and the power) of what we are all doing here...<BR>Let's 

hope that some other old 'software warriors' will join and help us drive the zombie 

commercial invaders 

out of our small 'Malta Isles' on the web...<BR>(I feel 'good' as well, with 

my smartcheck in the right hand and a Leffe Blonde in my left hand... only, though, 

I fear that 

SLH is being here a little too 

optimistic about Micro$oft's demise and our 'collective power' as voters... :-(<BR><BR>

> THROUGH THE WARP

>

> The software warriors

>

> In the year 1520, Prince Suleiman became the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.

> Two years later he successfully drove the last of the crusaders from the

> island of Rhodes, the Order of the Knight of Saint John.

>

> In 1530, the Emperor Charles V of Austria granted the Knights tenure on the

> Island of Malta where they rebuilt and re-established their Order.

>

> Suleiman, the greatest of the Ottoman Sultans, expanded the Ottoman Empire,

> in part because of the aggressive stance of Europe and the previous invasions

> by the crusaders. His reign saw not only military campaigns but art, law,

> and architecture.

>

> Suleiman saw himself as the defender of Islam and waged war in places

> ranging from Iran to Austria to make the Ottoman Empire one of the greatest

> of its time.

>

> In 1565, he undertook a campaign against the Island of Malta to establish a

> base to launch attacks on Europe. In one of the most ferocious sieges in

> history, the heavily outnumbered Knights and the heroic people of Malta

> eventually drove the invaders back until they withdrew after suffering

> terrible losses.

>

> A year later, Suleiman died after the battle of Szegedvar in Hungary and

> was succeeded by his remaining son Selim. The decline and fall of the

> Ottoman Empire over the next 300 years is generally attributed to the lack

> of Suleiman's genius by those who succeeded him.

>

> The parallels to the modern world of computing are very strong, empire

> building, major battles between corporate giants, great winners and ruined

> losers, the stuff that headlines are made from. In between are the little

> guys who were the vehicle of empire building, now dispossessed by the greed

> of those who used them.

>

> Those who have undertaken the quest to recover lost knowledge will have

> their API template up, running and honed like Excalibur. The next step is

> to start learning the art of swordplay.

>

> The art of swordplay

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> One of the additional "features" in 32 bit windows was the capacity to

> dynamically change colours and operating system component sizes. This

> capacity enabled normal users to customise the appearance of their system

> to meet their own needs and preferences but its implementation also created

> many headaches for win 32 programmers.

>

> Design an interface in VGA resolution and it is to small to read at high

> resolution, likewise, design an interface at a high resolution and it will

> not fit the screen at VGA or Super VGA resolution. Hard code the size of

> the buttons in VGA mode and the text will not fit onto them if the user

> has selected large fonts at high resolution.

>

> You can hard code the font size from a true type font so that it does not

> mess up the display but the solution is to dynamically size the interface

> to fit the users choice of resolution and font and this is done in a number

> of ways depending on the type of interface.

>

> For an MDI or similar window size interface, the process is relatively

> simple, the following two API calls get the current screen size in pixels

> which allows the window to be sized as it is being created.

>

>     Sw=GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN)

>     Sh=GetSystemMetrics(SM_CYSCREEN)

>

>     Wid = Sw * .75  ' Set width and height as percentages

>     Hgt = Sh * .70  ' of screen size.

>

> Feed this set of numbers into the four size parameters in the CreateWindowEx

> call and you have a resolution independent window that always starts at a

> similar appearance.

>

> An interface that is more like a dialog box with numerous controls on it is

> a bit more complex to size. You use the following function to get the base

> dialog units which return to you the width and height of the system font.

>

> ' Some variables for the processing of the return value

> ' ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>     GLOBAL uWd as LONG   ' Put these two in the header file so that they

>     GLOBAL uHt as LONG   ' are accessible from any part of your app.

>

>     LOCAL Unit as LONG

>     LOCAL lw   as WORD

>     LOCAL hw   as WORD

>

>     Unit = GetDialogBaseUnits()

>

> This is a simple function call but it leaves you with a problem in that the

> two values are returned as the high and low WORD values of a LONG value.

> This is less than convenient when much of the number twiddling that will be

> needed has to occur as LONG data types.

>

> There are ways of doing the conversions in high level languages but it is

> here where inline assembler provides an elegant solution. The technique

> treats the LONG value as an array of bytes at offsets 0,1,2,3. Copying the

> address of "Unit" at offset 0 into the ax register gets the low WORD of

> "Unit". Doing the same at offset 2 gets the high WORD.

>

>       mov ax, Unit[0]          ;  1  Get the loword of Unit

>       mov lw, ax               ;  1  copy it to 16 bit variable

>         xor eax, eax           ;  1  clear eax

>         mov ax, lw             ;  1  copy word variable to ax

>           cwde                 ;  3  convert ax to 32 bit in eax

>           mov uWd, eax         ;  1  copy eax into 32 bit variable

>

>       mov ax, Unit[2]          ;  1  Get the hiword of Unit

>       mov hw, ax               ;  1  copy it to 16 bit variable

>         xor eax, eax           ;  1  clear eax

>         mov ax, hw             ;  1  copy word variable to ax

>           cwde                 ;  3  convert ax to 32 bit in eax

>           mov uHt, eax         ;  1  copy eax into 32 bit variable

>

> The result is the font width in [ uWd ] and the font height in [ uHt ] as

> Colours set by the user in the "3D objects" option in the system's display

> properties are another source of headache for the win32 programmer. Make

> the assumption that everything is in generic grey and when a user sets their

> 3D objects to lime green or hot pink, you interface looks like a patchwork

> quilt.

>

> You basically have two choices, either control the entire interface or use

> the system colours that are available. The first option is difficult but

> possible under win 32, the second is reasonably straightforward.

>

> The system colours are listed under the WNDCLASSEX data type / structure in

> win32.hlp. With the "wc.hbrBackground" member of the WNDCLASSEX structure

> that provides the class background brush, substitute,

>   with one of the system colours. For a windows client area that is used for

> applications such as text or images, you are probably safer to stick to the

> standard "COLOR_APPWORKSPACE" where if you are laying out a dialog style

> interface, using "COLOR_BTNFACE" keeps the window the same colour as a

> normal dialog box.

>

> The M$ literature requires the colour to have a [ + 1 ] added to it so your

> WNDCLASSEX member will look like this,

>

>     wc.hbrBackground = COLOR_BTNFACE + 1

>

> Controls

> ~~~~~~~~

> Without a RAD front end generator, there is only one way to create controls,

> CreateWindow or CreateWindowEx API calls. The initial coding takes a little

> longer but once you place it in a function, a control is only a function

> call away. Controls differ from ordinary windows in as much as they are

> pre-defined classes where you don't have to set the class information in a

> WNDCLASS or WNDCLASSEX structure / Data type.

>

> Look up CreateWindow in win32.hlp and you will find the names of the popular

> control classes, "BUTTON", "EDIT", "LISTBOX" etc which you use when you make

> the CreateWindow call.

>

>     FUNCTION = CreateWindow("BUTTON","&OK", _

>                               WS_VISIBLE or WS_CHILD, _

>                                x,y,wid,hgt, _

>                                 hParent,ID,hInstance,0)

>

> Put this into a function call and you can re-use it as often as your code

> requires a button. You test if the button has been pressed by using a

> WM_COMMAND in your WNDPROC function. By trapping the LOWORD(wParam) part of

> the message, you get the control ID which identifies what action to take.

>

> If you use a control that needs additional processing, you "subclass" it.

> This is nothing more than a buzz term for writing a message handling

> function similar to a WNDPROC function.

>

> Call your function first to get its handle,

>

>     hEdit = MyEditCtrl( Parameters .... )

>

>  then you call the API,

>

>     lpMyProc=SetWindowLong(hEdit,GWL_WNDPROC, PointerTo-> MyCtrlProc)

>

>  and set the LONG value of the control's window class to the address of your

> message handler. Put the return address [ lpMyProc ] in the header file as a

> global variable so that your app can find it and then write the message

> handler.

> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

>     FUNCTION MyCtrlProc(BYVAL hCtl as LONG, _

>                           BYVAL Msg as LONG, _

>

>     END FUNCTION

> If you observe the basic discipline of writing both the opening and closing

> becomes easy to read and much easier to add to or modify later.

>

> Instead of fighting your way through a gaggle of different windows hoping to

> find one that will do the job, you just code what you want in a normal

> switch block / Select Case, and you have absolute control over your message

> processing.

> At the other end of the message processing spectrum, the functions that

> either send or post messages are also very efficient. You need to know

> enough about where and why you are sending or posting a message but in most

> instances, if you want an "object" to do something, you send a message to

> or encapsulate these functions on the assumptions that sending messages is

> general purpose advantage that messaging functions have. Sending messages is

> both very flexible and very powerful in a message based operating system so

> it is to the programmers advantage to get used to the technique.

>

> The fun stuff

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> Now once you have your controls and subclassing routines up and reliable,

> you can start to do cheeky things with them. A good example is a dialog

> type application where you need a matrix of buttons for things like

> calculators. Armed with the unit size of the system font that was returned

> by GetDialogBaseUnits() you can write functions that will display the

> numeric keypad, 1 to 9, 0, "." and "=" in a single function call.

>

> Twiddle the numbers for the function call and you can change the button

> position to the first call, all you need to do when adjusting the interface

> is to twiddle the numbers for the starting point at the top left corner and

> you can position the whole button pad where you want.
