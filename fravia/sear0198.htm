'to know an answer is easy, the difficult 

part is to know how to find any answer' (+ORC)



'don't waste your time doing it yourself, 

others have already done it for you' (Surreal)</PRE>(Part of the following is based on some private 

emailings from Surreal: Thanx a lot Surreal :-)<BR>

<HR width=44%></CENTER><BR><A name="anchorquisa"></A>

<FONT size=+2>Different techniques walking on the quicksand</FONT><BR>

<BR>You want to set up a site, prepare a paper, 

find information on a hurry about a target you want to crack, the butterflies of the 

Orinoco-river, german poets of the XVI century, old M”rklin steam locs, or 

silent actresses of the 1920's cinema?<BR><BR>



In 90% of the problem-solution situations you are  actually desperately

trying to do something that somebody else has ALREADY DONE, in fact you are 

seeking solutions for your problem that have ALREADY BEEN FOUND. Yes, but WHERE 

on the ever-expanding and quicksand moving deep deep web? For each of your 

projects there are some different constraints and caveats, as you'll see.

<BR><BR>

A crack for a new version of a program could have been made a few days

before you downloaded the program. In this case, good updated warez sites 

are a lot faster (and produce far far better results) than ftp search 

engines. 

<BR><BR>

The butterflies throw you hundred sites that are non relevant until you learn 

how to use advanced query features to EXCLUDE all non-university sites.

<BR><BR>

Most sites about german poets are irrelevant or dilettantesque until you learn to 

use strings in GERMAN to find relevant sites.

<BR><BR>

For M”rklin steam locs you of course need more PICTURES than text, and you'll have 

to learn how to use correctly the PICTURES tags in the advanced search queries

<BR><BR>

silent actress sites (as well as the preceding M”rklin locs sites) are 

better found and accessed using usenet queries than search engines.

<BR><BR>

The main problem, searching in this way, is the "Quicksand" aspect of the 

web: if you are searching through hotbot how much snow you have NOW on the 

alpine resorts you'll visit tomorrow, you won't be alused to find ton of links 

to the snow situation 8 months ago, when hotbot visited those sites, and 

then, trying to access them, to constate that more than 50% have disappeared, 

another good 30% was never updated and the remaining 20% have changed 

sector of interest :-(<BR><A name="anchorshoul"></A>

<BR><HR width=44%><BR><FONT size=+2>When you need to find something fast</FONT><BR><BR>

When you need to find something fast, use infoseek and "search only in

these results" a couple of times. Infoseek is the only search engine that 

keeps getting better and better. Altavista and Hotboat, on the contrary, 

are either stable or slightly worsening. This has a lot to do with the 

awful (and totally useless) 'commercialisation' of the web. Infoseek is 'coming back' 

from too much commercialisation (started as a 'payment' search engines), 

Altavista and Hotbot are 'going towards' commercialisation. And commercialisation, 

as you know is VERY BAD, because it has absolutely nothing to do with CONTENT, that 

is what you are supposed to be seeking <I>in primis</I>.<BR>As usual, history can 

help to find solutions. Web search 

engines used (many many years ago) to be no-frill EFFECTIVE search engines, 

dunnow if you know what a gopher Veronica search is... it's obsolete searching now, 

yet try it out, and compare that with 

hotbot -say, and you'll notice that not all differences are for the better.

Another aggravating commercial infection is that many search engines are 

PUSHING their results, <I>de facto</I> faking them.<BR>

They filter 

results and push commercial (paying) sites and/or commercial "friends" in 

the pole positions... as if all people using them were really so idiot 

to believe that their solution should dwell among the first ten results, 

and would never care examining the remaining pages... well, may be most 

people using those search engines ARE so stupid, I don't know.

<BR><BR>

Anyway, when you need to find something fast, use infoseek and "search 

only in these results" a couple of times. 

When you don't find anything this way, or when you need "time sensitive" 

information, use altavista's "advanced query", or hotbot date filter, and 

specify a date. 

<BR><BR>

If you still don't find what you need, make a <U>filter</U> in dejanews,

which is always VERY good for clues on where to look <U>instead</U> of 

searching it. 

<BR><BR>

Combining these three approaches will get you to a point where you 

hardly have to drop or "forget" anything you need.  

<BR><BR>You can solve

95% (or more) of the problem situations (looking for info) within

max 2 hrs, with these 3 search engines/filters. If you can't find it, you can 

be 90% sure it

can't be found on the (html based) web. However, the time sensitive info will 

still be a huge problem (people don't update keywords to the search engines,

so 90% of the time sensitive info you're looking for is noise). 

<BR><BR>There are various tools that notify you of uploads on the web. These 

tools may also be useful for stalking purposes (unless the webmaster has 

really a LOT of free time, you will soon recognize his time patterns and 

be able to reconstruct his REAL timezone).

<BR><A name="anchormonit"></A>

<BR><HR width=44%><BR><FONT size=+2>Site changes monitoring</FONT><BR><BR>



I recently came across a tool called Tierra highlights, which monitors

pages and notifies you of changes, then displays the page with the changes

made in another colour. 

<BR><BR>

I don't have to tell you that some of the page

mainteiners I targeted have been the ftp uploaders for *ahem* time 

sensitive programs, so

you can see what i'm getting at, I believe.<BR><BR>

I ran this proggie for the duration of the

evaluation period with the maximum nr of 15 sites and set the best pages

to update every 15 minutes. I got into the ftp sites nearly 9 out of 10 of

the times, (as i got the ftp info within 15 mins after the uploader put it

on his page). Beats the hell out of loading a page and not knowing how many

hours have gone by since it's last update (timezone delays etc).

<BR><BR>

Other possible uses: satelite channel codes pages, warez/passwords pages etc, 

but also realaudio pages, sensitive information pages and general stalking 

purposes.<A name="anchorprize"></A>

<BR><HR width=44%><BR><FONT size=+2>Tierra highlights: win a prize! (A small nice exercise)</FONT><BR><BR>

You may find this program at 

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.tierra.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.tierra.com/'" tppabs="http://www.tierra.com/">http://www.tierra.com/</A>. 

It's protection scheme is relatively easy to reverse, I'll leave 

to my readers the pleasure of working on it right now. Consider it a small +HCU 

exercise for February: best and most elegant short solution will gain 

once lmore a "strategical" nice prize (previous prize 

has been won by +Frog's Print as you may recall)

<BR><BR>

I would like to hear your opinion about this and any other 

"page updating" util you know of: if you know a better tool, please let 

me know (and write maybe a small essay on it).

 <BR>

 Go ahead, enjoy!<BR><BR>
