   FIRST, A NOTE FROM HACKMORE:



</PRE>   In my humble opinion, this is a totaly useless program with a totaly

useless, but extremely interesting, de-cryption scheme. It uses the

&quot;Cinderella&quot; time protection scheme, 30 days, but it's the registration

process that got me interested in it.<BR><BR>



   August arrived with the promise of help in my &quot;real life&quot; job, which

left

me with extra time on my hands, something I'm unaccustomed to. So with

an

active mind, and time to spare, I began looking through the lessons

+FRAVIA

has so kindly posted on his web pages. Eventualy, I drew two

conclusions:								 <BR><BR>



   1) A lot of these lessons deal primarily with how &quot;I&quot; cracked this

      program, instead of how &quot;TO&quot; crack this program. To achieve &quot;ZEN&quot;,

we

      must &quot;feel&quot; whats happening in a program. To do this, we must

      instictively &quot;know&quot; whats going on in the program. We need to

teach

      WHAT a program is DOING, NOT which bytes should be modified to

crack

      the program.									 <BR><BR>



   2) It's been a VERY long time since we heard from our teacher. (+ORC

sent

      lesson 4.2 last April.) So I figured somebody should assume the

role

      to teach us something new.							 <BR><BR>



   With these points in mind, I began preparing a lesson on de-cryption

techniques. My idea was to extract ALL of the code which processes the

registration code you enter when registering DNSWorkShop, explain whats

happening at EACH instruction, remove confusing line numbers and replace

them with informative labels, and nest the sub-processes so you could

see

just where you were at any given point in the process.<BR><BR>



   The idea was intended to &quot;teach&quot; new comers how the de-cryption

process

works, step by step, NOT how to reverse the process. Most of MY lessons

deal

with very little code, I prefer instead to explain the process so I

don't

&quot;scare&quot; new comers away from cracking. But the lesson I was preparing

was

nearly all, very well documented, code.	<BR><BR>



   Needless to say, as I was almost finished, fravia+ asked that we keep

the

code in our lessons to a minimum, and +ORC re-surfaced!<BR><BR>



   Although my hard work was wasted, and this program is so easily

cracked,

I still think I should explain the de-cryption process to anyone

interested

because the scheme is so elaborate. The author does just about anything

he

can to keep the potential cracker so busy and confused, the cracker will

finaly just give up. Yet this beautiful scheme was wasted in a program

that

can be cracked by changing only 1 byte!						   <BR><BR>



   At the end of this lesson, I'll show you a &quot;temporary&quot; crack as well

as a

&quot;permanent&quot; crack. Neither crack has anything to do with this

de-cryption

method. If you use my crack, you wont even have to register! So if

you're

not here to learn, you might as well jump to the goodies you're after.

But

you'll miss all the fun stuff if you do.<BR><BR>



   You'll probably find this lesson will be much easier to understand if

you

will get the program, dis-assemble it with WDASM, and study the code as

I

describe what the code is doing. This program can be easily cracked

using

only a dead listing, so give it a try.<BR><BR>

<HR>

   Enough digression, let's get to work. I'll assume at this point

you've

downloaded and installed the program, used it a bit, and are ready to

get

yourself a good working copy.

	<BR><BR>

   With SoftIce running, we'll load the program. Locate the &quot;register&quot;

button

and press it, and a little box pops up asking for your registration

code.

At this point, you have no idea if you should enter numbers or letters

or

both, so you can just type in your name. You might notice alot of extra

room

in the box, because it can take up to 26 characters.

			<BR><BR>

   Press F5 or <CTRL-d> to enter SoftIce, and do a search for the

information

you entered...		

          <PRE>s ds:0 lffffffff &quot;string you entered&quot;</PRE>



   Now you've found it, so you place a breakpoint on it...<BR><BR>



        bpr ds:&quot;start of string&quot; ds:&quot;end of string&quot; rw <BR><BR>



   And F5, let the program run. SoftIce breaks back in when the string

you

entered is being copied to a new location. Now you place a new

breakpoint,

just like you did above, and press F5 again to return to the program.

The

program runs its course, without ever breaking on your string again!

															   <BR><BR>

   What happened?! You were in a Windows module. When you wern't

looking, the

main program returned, so your breakpoint was invalid. Just re-load the

program, do the steps above again, and when you get to the second

address of

your string, hold down the F8 (trace) button for a few seconds to let

the

program re-gain control. Now do a new search for your string again, set

a

breakpoint on it, and get ready for the fun stuff!<PRE>



              ***   :0043BE63 8A00   mov al , [eax]   ***

													   </PRE>

   SoftIce will kick back in at the address CS:0043BE63, where you'll be

retrieving the first byte of your input string, and placing it into EAX

for

processing. Now would be a good time to shut down SoftIce, and load

DNSWorkShop into WDASM for dis-assembly. We used SoftIce to quickly find

where this program begins working on our input string, and it's a good

thing

we did because we got to this sub-routine by an indirect call, which

makes

finding this location in a dead listing very tedious. <BR><BR>



   But now that we know where to start, a dead listing will work just

fine

for the rest of this lesson. If you'll follow this through, using either

SoftIce or a dead listing, here's what you will find...

  <BR><BR>

   Eax is cleared, leaving only the first byte from your string. This

byte is

copied to ECX, then checked to see if it's a number, a letter, or a

symbol.	 <BR>

If your character is not one of the above, (if it's a graphics or

control	  

character) you get kicked out. If your character is a letter, it's

checked

again to see if it's an upper case letter or a lower case letter.

		  <PRE>

   If it's a...             Do this...

   ------------------------------------------

   Upper case letter        subtract 37

   lower case letter        subtract 3D

   number                   subtract 30

   symbol                   change to 3F

   control character        change to 3E

			   </PRE>

   Now save the result in memory (at [00440030]) for later, get the next

byte in the string, and process it the same way. We'll save the result

of

this second byte as the value of EDI, because we're not using EDI for

anything else right now, and our memory location already has the first

byte

stored in it, and we're about to do some math which will require EAX.

Here's

an exerpt from the original lesson I told you about earlier in this

lesson...			 <BR><BR>

<PRE>

MAIN

   mov edi, eax              ;store result for use after MULTIPLY

   mov eax, 00000040         ;the number to multiply by

   call MULTIPLY



   MULTIPLY

      imul edx, [00440030], 08088405  ;EAX * EDX * &quot;KEY&quot; * 08088405

      inc edx                         ;add &quot;1&quot; just for fun

      mov [00440030], edx             ;save as next &quot;KEY&quot;

      mul edx                         ;EAX * EDX (low bytes * high bytes)

      mov eax, edx                    ;save the high order double word

      ret                             ;to MAIN



MAIN

   xor edi, eax                       ;finish de-crypting the first byte

   mov eax, edi                       ;save the result

</PRE><HR>

   Here, we do a signed multiplication. If SBR is your Second Byte

Result,

and FBR is your First byte result, the equation would look like this:

		  <PRE>

                     IMUL   40 * SBR * FBR * 08088405

			   </PRE>

   Just in case our result was too small to get a number into EDX, we'll

add a &quot;1&quot; to EDX to be sure we'll have a &quot;key&quot; to use on the next byte.

Then

save this &quot;high order byte + 1&quot; to use as the next &quot;key&quot; value.

					 <BR><BR>

   The result of our IMUL leaves the result in EDX:EAX, meaning the

biggest

part of the number is in EDX, and the lesser numbers are placed in EAX.

So

the next step multiplies the large part of the number by the low part of

the number. To put this all in perspective, lets say the result of the

IMUL

instruction turned out to be 3031323334 in hex:

							 <PRE>

              EDX would equal 30        <THEN we add "1" to it) EAX would equal 31323334 </prE>

   So the next step would multiply 31 * 31323334, which, again, leaves

the

result in EDX:EAX. The low order bits (in EAX) are thrown away as we

move

the high order bits (in EDX) into EAX. Anyone concerned with reversing

this

process might find it difficult without the bytes we throw away.

										<BR><BR>

   We now XOR the result of this process against the result we got when

we

processed the second byte of our input registration code. Remember, we

saved

that result in EDI just before we started multiplying.

												<BR><BR>

   We'll take the result from above and &quot;fix&quot; it depending on it's value

using the same formula from above, but this time ADDING 30, 37, or 3D to

obtain a number, upper case letter, or lower case letter. (Remember, we

subtracted these same values when we began this process) We also get the

options of comming up equal to 3D, or 3E, (which will pass the &quot;ok&quot;

range

of characters), or getting kicked out if we end up with an invalid

character.

If you had entered a bunch of random characters into the input box, AND

if

you got REAL lucky, the character you MIGHT end up with at this point

MIGHT

be the first letter of your name, which is what we would LIKE to see

here!													<BR><BR>



   If we've made it this far, we get a chance to store our first

de-crypted

byte for future use. Again, here's an excerpt from my original lesson...

<HR>

STORAGE PROCESS<BR>

   The de-cryption process is now completed for this byte of our

   registration code. The storage process takes the byte we have placed

   on the stack, and checks for any errors we may have encountered,such

as

   an &quot;out of range&quot; byte, etc. If an error is found, a flag is set and 

   we're sent to the function which processes error codes and, of

course, 

   get kicked out of the program.

				   <BR><BR>

   If all goes well, we get an address to store this byte in memory,

   then store this byte. If you follow each byte through it's storage

   process, you will notice there are many different places in memory

   where these bytes are stored, in a seemingly random pattern. Only 

   one byte of de-crypted code will be stored at each location, but it 

   will be stored as a double-word. (Each place in memory will have the 

   bytes &quot;00 00 00 10&quot; when we arive, and we'll replace the &quot;10&quot; with

our 

   de-crypted byte, so it might look like &quot;00 00 00 41&quot; if our input 

   character de-crypted to the letter &quot;A&quot;.) This address MIGHT get used 

   again, overwriting the byte we store there with a new byte, or it

MIGHT 

   NOT. This is important to note for cracking purposes!

						   <BR><BR>

   When we get a few bytes packed away in memory, we set up a new

   address where we'll create a (doubleword sized) partial string,

   adding de-crypted bytes as we get them. We will attatch ONLY the

   bytes just de-crypted in the steps above, to the end of this partial

   string, so our partial string might look like &quot;Hack&quot; in memory when

   we're through with it. Once again, if you follow the process through,

   you will find these &quot;partial strings&quot; get copied a few times too. The

   &quot;partial string&quot; we leave behind MIGHT get over-written, or it MIGHT

be 

   left alone for processing later.<BR><BR>



   Eventualy, we'll get an address where we'll place the entire

   de-crypted registration string, which will be used to determine 

   wether or not we've registered properly. If you view the memory 

   location, it might look like &quot;Hackmore Readrite - 1234&quot;, The string

YOU 

   get will, of course, depend on the input you provide. If you entered 

   your name as I suggested above, you'll probably end up with a garbled 

   string of numbers, letters, and symbols.

										   <BR><BR>

   The storage addresses selected change with the length of the

   registration code you type in. If your string is too long, you'll

   get to see your de-crypted string stored in memory right below the

   original string you typed in. This may be handy for anyone who might

   want to compare strings.						   <BR><BR>



   After storing this single byte, we get a chance to spend alot of

   frustrating time looking up addresses and anything else the author

   of this program could think of to slow us down. This takes us through

   all kinds of code to NOT check our string against what has been saved

   in the registry. It's a very long process dealing with setting up 

   addresses, checking string length and values, and setting &quot;switch&quot;

   values to determine wether or not the machine should enter the

registry 

   yet. (Has the entire string been processed?, Is the string length 

   correct?, etc.) Since we're not already registered, a switch will

always

   tell the program not to enter the registry yet. This process was 

   probably placed here to frustrate the average cracker, by making the 

   process so long you just give up. And remember, it's repeated after

   EACH byte we'll de-crypt, and MANY times later as you'll see!

														   <BR><HR>

   The next two processes are rather boring. The first checks each byte

in

the de-crypted string, and if it is an asterix &quot;*&quot; it will be passed

into

the second process, which will convert it to a space &quot; &quot; character. This

will

check, and repair if nessesary, each byte of the de-crypted string.	<BR>

																   <BR>

   Yet another chance to check our de-crypted code against whats stored

in the registry, (remember, we're still UNREGISTERED so there's nothing

to

check against!) along with the normal error checks and clean-up to

finish

up these sub-routines. As usual, if an error is found, we'll be kicked

out of

the program. If everything looks good, we'll set a bunch of bytes in

memory

to tell the program it's alright to go on to the next process. Since

we're

not already registered, a switch will tell the program not to open the

registry yet, but we still have to cruise through all the code

pertaining

to opening, reading, and closing the registry each time we come through

this

&quot;registry check&quot; crap. Basicaly, this is just one more attempt to slow

down

the average cracker, although this time, some of what is done IS

important,

like cleaning up after the sub routine, and setting bytes in memory to

tell

the program it's ok to proceed.

	  <BR><BR>

   This is the point where we learn that our input string should have

been

24 characters long. So do the steps above 23 more times, and you will

have

de-crypted the entire string. But we're not even close to being done

yet,

unless you just came for the de-cryption lesson. What will we do with

this

de-crypted string in order to determine if you've registered properly?

Read

on to learn more.

			  <PRE>

              ***   :0043BEB5 E88AFEFFFF   call 0043BD44   ***

				   </PRE>

   Now it's time to DO something with this string we've de-crypted so

nicely.

We'll start at the end, rather than the beginning, because (if you saw

the

MULTIPLY code earlier) the end of the string is where we would be MOST

likely

NOT to succeed. An error EARLY in the process would have a &quot;snowball&quot;

effect

right on down the line, getting larger, and larger as we de-crypted each

byte, because the result of one pass through the MULTIPLY sub-routine

sets

the &quot;key&quot; for the next pass.

						 <BR><BR>

   Do the math if you are inclined, but to put it simply, from an

incredibly

large number of possible combinations of characters, we only have ten

choices

for the end of our string. The last four characters MUST be NUMBERS (0 -

9)

or we get kicked out of the program.

								 <BR><BR>

   Assuming YOU were lucky enough to end up with four numbers at the end

of

your de-crypted string, (I sure wasn't), the program copies the last

doubleword of your de-crypted string to a new location in memory. Pour

yourself a tall one for this process because you'll also get to NOT

enter

the registry FOUR more times durring this process, complete with error

checking, address look-ups, etc.		 <BR><BR>



   With our doubleword in hand, we'll strip away the first byte, convert

it

to decimal (subtract 30), multiply the &quot;talley&quot; (which is &quot;0&quot; for the

first

character), double the result, and add our decimal number to it. Then do

the same for the remaining three bytes. For an example of this, read

just a

bit further. We'll have to do this one more time, so I've included the

code

and an explanation when we reach that point in this de-cryption scheme.

												 <BR><BR>

   Just in case we wandered in here with something other than numbers in

our

de-crypted doubleword, we get all kinds of chances to get kicked out of

the

program. And they'll all send us away thinking we've done a good thing,

until much later when the error flag gets tested. Then it's good bye bad

cracker! If we've done a good job, we'll sail through all that registry

crap

again, complete with all the frills, about three more times.

														 <BR><BR>

   If nothing has gone wrong, we move the result from this last process

back

onto the stack, determine the length of our de-crypted string WITHOUT

the

last four bytes which we just processed above, determine an address to

copy

the shortened de-crypted string to, (without the last four bytes),

determine

if a registration string exists in the registry yet, (only reading it if

it

IS there), or if you have only just typed it in, and finaly, we'll move

the

shortened de-cryped string to a new address, without the last four

bytes. The

original string and the original de-crypted string will remain where

they

have been placed in memory. They will each contain thier entire 18h (24

dec)

bytes of input code, or de-crypted code respectively.<PRE>



              ***   :0043BF54 E89B77FCFF   call 004036F4   ***

														  </PRE>

   And, after a bit of setup, (getting addresses and updating counters)

we're

ready for the next step, a very simple process of adding each byte of

the

shortened de-crypted string together, to get a sum of the hex values of

each

de-crypted byte. ((H=48) + (a=61) = A9 + (c=63) = 10C +  (k=6B) = 177...

etc.

Until we've added all of the remaining 20 bytes, spaces are skipped

though.)										 <BR><BR>



   After this 20 byte de-crypted string is tallied, it's added to &quot;3&quot;

just

for kicks, and this doubleword result is saved for a CMP instruction

later.													 <BR><BR>



   Ahh... My ears are ringing with the sound of all those happy crackers

out

there thinking &quot;JUST FIX THE CMP INSTRUCTION!&quot; If you've read this far,

you

will know that this program has MANY error checks! One slip and you WILL

get

kicked out.														 <BR><BR>



   When registered, this program stores the string you entered into the

registry under:

 <PRE>

    \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Info Evolution\DNS WorkShop\Registration

	  </PRE>

   And when it goes there to check up on you, you'll get kicked out

before

you ever reach that CMP instruction. The string is stored in the

registry

exactly as you typed it in, so each time the program is run, the string

goes through this same process again. Fixing the CMP instruction WILL

get

you &quot;registered&quot;, and you'll get to see your de-crypted input string in

the

cute little box that say's &quot;Successfuly registered to...&quot;, but when you

re-open the program, your &quot;saved&quot; input string will pass through this

same

process again, and you will be UN-registered. There's no &quot;zen&quot; in that!

			<BR><BR>

   Now that we have all the work done on our input string and the

resulting

de-crypted string, it's time to check access rights. This is a VERY long

process that jumps to places all over the program just to completely

confuse anyone who has made it this far. All it does is check a two

character string to determine if this is a (%d) demo version, or a (%u)

user

version. Anything other than a &quot;d&quot; or a &quot;u&quot; will get you kicked out of

the

program. Again, the author lets you &quot;play around&quot; awhile before he lets

you

get kicked out. So you'll get to do alot of jumps from a jump table, and

a

lot of checks for &quot;$&quot;, &quot; &quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, etc. You'll also get to check

for

numbers, and capitalize lower case letters. Anything and everything to

confuse the &quot;wanna-be&quot; cracker.

					<BR><BR>

   And, just for fun, when we're done with the distraction above, the

author

was kind enough to throw in a few more trips past the registry, with all

the

frills as usual. What a nice guy!

							<BR><BR>

   But finaly we return to the task at hand. Just a bit more code to

help

me explain this step. This is the code, and explanation of it, that I

promised you when we were working with the last four bytes of the

de-crypted input string. Here we're working with the doubleword result

derived from adding the first 20 bytes of our de-crypted string. This is

another snippet of code from my original lesson...

									<BR>

<HR><PRE>

NEXT_BYTE

   test bl , bl            ;do we have a byte to process?

   je EXIT                 ;leave if we don't

   sub bl, 30              ;convert to a decimal number

   cmp bl, 09              ;is it a number?

   ja EXIT                 ;leave if it's not

   cmp eax, edi            ;make sure our number hasn't grown too large

                           ;(we put &quot;0CCCCCCC&quot; in EDI earlier in this proc)

   ja EXIT                 ;leave if we got too big

   lea eax, [eax + 4*eax]  ;use an address as our tally

   add eax, eax            ;EAX = &quot;0&quot;, but it grows as we calculate.

   add eax, ebx            ;now, add our byte from the doubleword

   mov bl , [esi]          ;get the next byte

   inc esi                 ;set the byte pointer for the next byte

   test bl , bl            ;do we have anything?

   jne NEXT_BYTE           ;if yes, go back to process it

   dec ch                  ;if not, set the flag to leave

   je FLAG_CHECK           ;then go check it, this is a &quot;3-way&quot; flag

                           ;it can be a good &quot;FF&quot; as we've recieved here

                           ;or a bad &quot;00&quot; or &quot;01&quot; which we would pick up

                           ;if this process fails (if we have a letter

                           ;instead of a number, for instance.)</PRE>

<HR>

   I'll use 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4 as an example of whats going on here for the

benifit of all those &quot;wanna-be's&quot; who don't quite understand the math.

	<PRE>

      EAX + (4 * EAX)           EAX + EAX             EAX + EBX

      --------------------------------------------------------------

       0 + (4 *  0) =   0  --&gt;    0 +   0 =   0  --&gt;    0 + 1 =   1



       1 + (4 *  1) =   5  --&gt;    5 +   5 =  0A  --&gt;   0A + 2 =   C



       C + (4 *  C) =  3C  --&gt;   3C +  3C =  78  --&gt;   78 + 3 =  7B



      7B + (4 * 7B) = 267  --&gt;  267 + 267 = 4CE  --&gt;  4CE + 4 = 4D2

<HR> 

As you can see, the end result adds up quickly. And this time, we end

up with four different values describing the first 20 bytes (or last 4

bytes if you've skipped here from above) of our input string... 

<PRE>

   Our input         = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

   De-crypted        = Hackmore Readrite - 

   Sum of Hex values = 1234

   Re-calculated     = 04D2

	 </PRE>

   We are finaly done with all this crap, so now we can return to the

main

program to use that CMP instruction I spoke of earlier. Of course we

must

do that registry thing several more times first, just because we've come

this far! And as usual we make all three passes (open, read, and close)

and

do all kinds of error checking and clean-up.

		   <BR><BR>

   So far we've typed in an input string, de-crypted it, stripped off

the

last four bytes and checked to be sure they were numbers, re-calculated

the result to get yet another number, checked the access rights, added

up

the hex values of the first 20 bytes of our string, and re-calculated

that

result to get yet another value. And at last we've reached that

&quot;critical&quot;

instruction which will let you use this program only once if you care to

adjust the values. <PRE>



              ***   :0043BF8E 3BD8   cmp ebx, eax   ***

						</PRE>

   This also brings us to the end of my lesson on this de-cryption

technique. Now I will show you two different ways to crack this program.

<HR>

   Using a dead listing and a bit of &quot;zen&quot;, it was obvious that the data

address DS:[00440030] was being used for more reasons than just the IMUL

instruction listed earlier in this lesson. It did not take long to

figure

out why after firing up SoftIce.

	<BR><BR>

   Load the UNREGISTERED copy of this program into SoftIce, and place a

breakpoint on the memory doubleword used in the multiplication

sub-routine

used for the de-cryption process.

			<PRE>

                        BPMD DS:00440030 RW

				 </PRE>

   Then press F5 (ctrl-d) to return to the program. You will pop back

into

SoftIce very quickly. Press F5 again, and when SoftIce returns dump

DS:ESI.

Hold the &quot;ALT&quot; key down, while pressing the &quot;down&quot; arrow key 14 times.

Here

you will see the following encrypted string...

					   <PRE>

                    Tgq'bxGrrsaiper,Ieuutvm+3

							</PRE>

   After you have registered your program, your registration input

string

will show up here, and the encrypted string above will be gone. You can

follow this through the de-cryption process, (it's a VERY simple

process),

or you can just take my word for it, but either way, it de-crypts to the

following string...				  <PRE>



                    ObjectContainer.Network.1

									   </PRE>

   Sorry, lamers, the de-cryption process used to de-crypt this string

WILL

NOT de-crypt a registration input string! But it WILL give you the name 

above, which is the &quot;key&quot; to search for in your registry. Once you've

found

the &quot;key&quot;, simply delete it for another FREE 30 DAY TRIAL. This &quot;key&quot;

holds

the information to tell the program how long you've been using it. It

will be

replaced the next time you use the program, so you'll have to delete it

every thirty days.	 <BR><BR>



   That's enough &quot;lamer&quot; training, now I'll show you professionals how

to

REALY crack the program.	 <BR>

<HR>

   After dis-assembling the file DNSWorkShop.exe using Wdasm, one of the

first things you'll notice is the message &quot;No Dialog resources in this

aplication.&quot; Yet, scanning the dead listing, you'll find several

references

to &quot;string data reference to code object&quot; within the program. So a

simple

search for the string &quot;registered&quot; leads us to...

								 <PRE>

               &quot;Successfuly registered to&quot; at CS:0043C7E3

									  

                                  AND



             &quot;This product is registered to&quot; at CS:0043D377

									   </PRE>

   Our good friend SoftIce was kind enough to show us the exact point

where the de-cryption process began. With a little back-tracking from

that point, (that's back-TRACKING, not back-TRACING) through the dead

listing, we find that the sub-routine containing the address CS:0043BE63

begins at CS:0043BE30, which is called from CS:0043BF30. A bit more

back-tracking shows the sub-routine containing the address CS:0043BF30

actualy begins at CS:0043BEE4, which is called from CS:0043C1A0. One

more

time, we back-track to find the sub-routine containing the address

CS:0043C1A0 begins at CS:0043C16C, which is accessed by an indirect call

from somewhere.								 <BR><BR>



   Logic, or &quot;zen&quot; would dictate that this is probably the &quot;true&quot;

begining

of the registration process. (Because it's CALLer is a mystery, and it

leads

us right to the de-cryption process) A quick scan of this small

sub-routine

shows us that it happily returns to its caller when finished. As you can

see

by the addresses I've listed above, or better yet by viewing your own

dead

listing, the code below this sub-routine contains all kinds of &quot;string

data&quot;

references, including the ones we are after.

<BR><BR>

   But look closely at the sub-routine itself! Right before your very

eyes,

only four instructions before you call the other sub-routines to get and 

de-crypt your registration input string, THERE IT IS! THE switch which

determines if you are registered, or just a bum using this program for

free.

<PRE>

   :0043C195 B301            mov bl, 01         <RIGHT HERE! :0043C197 8D4DF8 lea ecx, [ebp-08] :0043C19A 8B5604 mov edx, [esi+04] :0043C19D 8B45FC mov eax, [ebp-04] :0043C1A0 E83FFDFFFF call 0043BEE4 <---get & de-crypt input </prE>

   Simply changing the &quot;01&quot; to a &quot;00&quot; will crack this program, the &quot;key&quot;

in

your registry called &quot;ObjectContainer.Network.1&quot; will be permantly

removed

from your computers registry, and the registration input string you

typed

will be placed in the &quot;registration&quot; key in your computers registry.

	  <BR><BR>

   I must confess at this point, I have NOT figured out a way to reverse

the

math used in the de-cryption process. I know what my name is, so there's

no

need for me to see it in print. I'm sure the math COULD be reversed

though.

So when you press the &quot;About this Software&quot; tab, you'll see the message

&quot;This product is registered to&quot;, but, unfortunately, your name will not

be

there. If you dis-like this software as much as I do, you'll just throw

it

away as soon as you're finished learning from it anyway.

			  <BR><BR>

   I hope you have learned something from this lesson. I've tried to

show

you that de-crypting is not that difficult, and also the many &quot;traps&quot; a

programer might set to slow down and frustrate a potential cracker.

					  <BR><BR>

   There are several REALY GOOD crackers in the +HCU, maybe someday we'll

all

get to be as good as they are. I'm working on it, and YOU should be too!

But

don't let the programers &quot;trick&quot; you into giving up by using methods

like

the ones I've shown you here.

										   <BR><BR>

   Welcome back +ORC. Thanks to you, fravia+, and all the rest, for your

fine works. We are all islands in a sea of greed, but together we can

form a

continent. Legend has it that intellegent life first apeared on dry

land.
