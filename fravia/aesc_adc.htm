                        Advanced Disk Catalog v. 1.12

          ("Redundant instructions: the undiscovered treasure")

                              By Aesculapius





	There was a time when CPU's were turtles and hard drives smaller than

your RAM capacity is today. Considering this panorama, it's understandable

why assembly coding was so necessary to enhance applications performance;

things have changed though, hardware does not limit today's programmers and it's

possible and desirable to use a more sophisticated high level programming

language instead of pure assembly. These facts have obvious consequences: 

most programs include unnecessary instructions and such thing could represent

an open door for a very well shielded protection scheme. We'll deal in this

essay with debugging and patching unfriendly application. 

ADC 1.12 code is very sensitive to patching procedures. 

Slight changes, for instance JNE to JE, will hang the whole thing, or simply, 

although logic suggests that some change should crack the scheme, you can hold 

your breath and count to one thousand because nothing will happen. 

This is especially true if the changes are carried out in code locations "close" 

to the protection scheme. 

The main validation code resides in a *.DLL file named VALIDATE.DLL; to

produce a more robust anti-crackers strategy, there's a checksum in the main

executable (ADC.EXE) to validate the integrity of VALIDATE.DLL (one

validation over another, interesting!). The scheme code itself inside

VALIDATE.DLL will be executed many times. As you can see, paranoia in

it's maximum expression!

	

	To figure out that the protection scheme was inside VALIDATE.DLL,

Win-eXpose-I/O 95 v. 2.00 (WXI) probed to be a formidable tool. You can

locate it at <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.shetef.com/wxi95-20.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.shetef.com/wxi95-20.zip'" tppabs="http://www.shetef.com/wxi95-20.zip">http://www.sheltef.com/wxi95-20.zip</A>, 1.1 Mb. You should also

get Win-eXpose-Registry 95 v. 1.00 at <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.sheltef.com/wxr95-10.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.sheltef.com/wxr95-10.zip'" tppabs="http://www.sheltef.com/wxr95-10.zip">http://www.sheltef.com/wxr95-10.zip</A>,

	Using Winice, set a breakpoint at CS:4061CC (BPX CS:4061CC), and

execute the following instruction: "D ECX" after winice pops up, the memory

location where the valid password is stored will be revealed. If you're too

lazy, then use this data, Serial Number: AESCULAPIUS, Password: f3e39742.

	Sheltef Solutions programmers should be strong candidates to win the

stupidity award, because all their products use not only the same protection

scheme, but also the same code generation sequence! So this data will

unprotect Win-eXpose-Registry too... you wont believe it: the same password

works over and over for every single program, this is too much!

                                                  ; :1C0018E1 (look back)

:1C0019BF 33C8        xor ecx, eax ; if EAX<>1E (30 decimal) then XOR EAX

                                   ; and EAX=0 Unreg.

:1C0019C1 E93A000000  jmp 1C001A00                ; Returns to the CALLer



At this point we could easily crack this schemes by changing instruction 

:1C0019BF from XOR EAX,EAX to XOR ECX,EAX, this would erase ECX 

leaving EAX intact, if EAX<>0 the program is Registered, and the 

protection scheme would be disabled. Off course, we would have to deal 

with the checksum (read the validate.dll checksum annihilation add on, at 

the end of this essay). 



However, we want to go for the gold, lets calculate the valid serial 

number: we know that the validation code is calculated according to the 

following equation: (first digit - eighth digit) * (second digit - 

seventh digit)= 1Eh = 30 Decimal. The high order bits of EAX should be 

"0" because this value will be stored in EDX and finally EDX is 

subtracted from EAX.



        So lets begin with this tentative 8 digits number:



        88776623 ; Applying the equation: (8 - 3) * (8 - 2) => (5) * (6) = 

30 Decimal = 1E Hexadecimal.



	(Don't forget to check the SUB REGISTER, 30 instruction ADD ON, at 

the end of this document)



	This attempt will pass the first validation test and leads the 

execution to the following piece of code:

	The equation looks like this: (third digit - sixth digit) * (fourth

        digit - fifth digit) = 06h = 6 Decimal.



        Lets modify our tentative number according to this:



       Valid Number: 88552323, where, (5 - 3) * (5 - 2) =>

       (2) * (3) = 6 Decimal = 06hex.



        This number seems to pass all tests.



	Now try to register ADC 1.12 with the Serial Number: 88552323 and

        it works!





                       VALIDATE.DLL ANNIHILATION ADD ON



	Once we've cracked the file validate.dll with our favorite hex

editor, everything seems to be fine, but when we double click on the main

executable (ADC.EXE), another window pops up!!! VALIDATE.DLL missing or

invalid. No!!!, there's a checksum to verify the integrity of the .dll file,

Damn!!!

	We're sitting in our workbench once again. If you try to execute

ADC.EXE with WXI in memory, it'll inform you that the checksum resides in

the main executable (ADC.EXE) itself. So lets disassemble this file with

wdsm85 and hit the search button looking for this sequence: "VALIDATE.DLL is

missing or invalid". We land here:

:004093B3 50                      push eax



Pay attention to this explanation: The checksum is calculated at :409319,

then, the checksum of the modified file is stored at memory location

[48F7FC], the valid checksum of the original file is stored at EDX from

memory location [4815E8]. At instruction :409322 both values are compared

and the decision is taken at instruction :409324 which will jump if the

checksums values are different. Changing the JNE to JE won't crack this

scheme, because the invalid checksum has already been stored at a memory

location where it'll be checked by other locations of the code. The

programmer was very intelligent because he moved the invalid checksum from a

register (EAX) to the memory, and the valid checksum from memory to a

register (EDX); this particular configuration will prevent us to move the

right checksum to the invalid checksum memory location, because assembly can

not move data directly from one memory location to another (except by the

use of rep movs instructions). We can't move the right cheksum to EAX at

409317 (MOV EAX, [4815E8]) because the program will crash. This piece of code

is not as easy to crack as it seems.



	Now load ADC.EXE with WINICE press ctrl-d, set a breakpoint at

cs:409322 to see what's the difference between both checksums. Start ADC and

WINICE will pop up. Execute: ? EAX and ? EDX to check both values. You get

this:

		

			EAX: F4E9C8A1

			EDX: F4E9C8A9



	The difference resides in the last digit; you also know that EAX

value is stored backwards at [48F7FC], this means that A1 will be

stored at the first byte of that memory location. All we have to do

to crack this mess is search for a redundant instruction to change the byte

at [48F7FC] from A1h to A9h. Searching backwards in the code we find the

perfect instruction (mov byte ptr) at :40926E. To be sure that it is in fact

redundant, set a breakpoint at CS:40926E and when WINICE pops up, execute:

d [48F348]. Just what I thought, this byte is already zero before the

instruction stores 00 at it, therefore, it's redundant and not necessary. 



	Finally, to crack the checksum, change this:



:0040926E C60548F3480000 mov byte ptr [0048F348],00 



to



:0040926E C605E8154800A9 mov byte ptr [0048F7FC],A9 



        The checksum has been defeated!



        Don't forget this: redundant instructions are frequently located at

push & pop sequences of the beginning and ending of almost every CALL. You

may use this spare bytes at your will!



                    SUB REGISTER, 30 INSTRUCTION ADD ON

                               By Aesculapius



	Many programs use the instruction: SUB REGISTER, 30 to convert a

hexadecimal number to its decimal equivalent. Locating instructions like

this one, for instance: SUB EAX, 30 several times in the same piece of code

will warn you about two things:



1. A valid code calculation sequence could be there.

2. This instruction is used only with numbers (not with letters). So there

are as many numbers in the serial code as SUB REGISTER, 30 instructions in

the asm code.
