Motorroad malls</H3></B></CENTER>

<BR>

Well, I would be scared as well if the information provided by 

Curious George should be confirmed to be true. I need a confirmation 

because I must admit that (until now)

 I have personally never encountered something that scary. Somebody wrote recently that

 a reality cracking essay was "<U>not only a shopping list from +ORC's

supermarket theory</U>". Nice words, yet I believe that 

-as you'll read in this very document- +ORC's 

great clever past seeds are still FAR from

 having been completely exploited... man, he wrote his <A HREF="slaves.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/slaves.htm">Supermarket enslaving tricks</A> in march 

1997... that's EONS ago in Web-time... and we are still far from really working on 

that... :-(<BR>

 As soon as I read Curious George's essay, I wished to add a 

couple of observations of my own, which I deem useful as a possible 

'starting snowball'.<BR>Said comments of mine will now follow, and 

regard specifically many 

'<U>European 'motor-road malls</U>'.  (I'm sure that my friends in the States -and elsewhere- 

will have very similar targets).<BR>Anyway I have seen -and unfortunately experienced- these horrible things all over Europe (M–wenpick 

in Switzerland, 'Three goose' in Benelux), but I will use a 



 "made in Italy" example  that I unfortunately had to endure  once more  

during my last trip 

-per car- to Venice (in Italy, still a town without any car whatsoever, very nice 

indeed, 

even if 

the stupid political local populace is more and more  succeeding in 

transforming it in a sort of stupid (and useless) commercial cross between Disneyland 

and San Marino).<BR> 

To understand what follows (if you are reading this outside the European 

Union or in the middle of nowhere) you must know that 

there are some huge 'super-malls' built across the 

Italian motor-roads (called 'Alemagna' or 'Pavese' or whatever). 

I cannot understand why the 

hell someone in his right mind would want to sit down for his 

rare minutes of relax during a journey smack in the middle of a motor-road. 

 I believe that's sort of a masochistically oriented attitude, and that you would 

act that way only in order to watch even more cars running by (actually 

under your nose) 

at full speed... funny enough, after having  

tripped so many kilometers among (pukeworthy) zillions of similar cars...<BR>

These malls are such an abomination... one wonders: 

why don't they build small cottages and rest places 

'in the green' instead, with no noises whatsoever, 

small tables and soft music under high shadowy trees, why don't they offer you 

a quiet place of silence, a small place where all the slaves 

that finally managed to escape for half an hour their car (or their Bus, 

or their lorry) would for a precious couple of minutes <U>NOT</U> be compelled to 

see, smell, touch, experience the frantic 

lurid traffic they had to endure during their whole journey?<BR>

This kind of developments puzzle me quite a lot. Is it a purposefully 

prepared torture from 

some sadistically oriented power that be? Or, more simply, is it due to the fact that 

there's probably 

no low limit whatsoever in the idiotically European mimicking of every  

awful solution or trick that has been concocted -and applied- by the   

'commercial 

contorted' American minds?<BR>

Anyway just try it for the sake of it  and stop on your journey when you meet 

such places (quite a hard 

lesson to learn if you ask me, yet useful indeed). Stop there 

and have a cold long 'reverser' look around you (yes you are a green slimy alien in 

this context of happy idiots... just look, evaluate,  

register and send back info to this galaxy... pink funny stupid 

earthlings around you wont understand that you have come from the 'reality 

cracking academy' of Aldebaran :-)<BR>Loo! These malls are so structured that you WILL NOT find your coffee 

or your toilets on the ground floor... you'll have to take an elevator, or a lift, 

to the first floor... but it will take you nevertheless quite a while to get to 

the 'level exit' (like in Doom, thinking of it... may be we should treat 

all our visits to a supermarket like a doom game... :-)

The criminal layout of these sites (I would like to dump the architects that 

studied and prepared these 'commercial killing fields' in the middle of a motor-road, 

possibly with a cement block around their feet...  

:-) will compel 

you to cross a labyrinth of interminable crappy products on offer... in order 

to finally get your simple coffee... the layout is stupid but effective:  in order to get to the bar or 

to the toilets 

all visitors MUST go through the whole assortment of overpriced salami, 

plastic model 

cars, videos, whatever crappish and totally useless they want to sell you (and <U>always</U> overpriced: 

anywhere in that country the same products would cost you less than on those motor-road 

malls). Once you have drunk your coffee or used the toilet you'll have -once more-  

to go trough a maze of crap in order to go out and continue your motor-road journey. 

<BR>There's absolutely no way you 

can avoid this torture. What is really funny, btw, is that most of the ubiquitous 

'cretini con telefonini' and 'coglioni con gipponi' (the

main 'categories' of Italian citizens :-) seem to like it a lot. Moreover 

since most 

of the 'objects on offer' seem to be 'casually' stapled (in reality they are 

very artfully positioned... you feel as 

if it would just be so easy to pick some of them <I>en passant</I>), most of them hinder 

your movement through this commercial abomination. Therefore the 

only defense I was able to invent at the moment was to simply walk trough 

this seaweed of commercial crap WITHOUT caring 

the least about all the artful posed salami-mountains and "die cast car models" 

landscapes, 'reversing' (in the 

simplest -yet quite effective- sense of the word) mountains of them :-)

<BR>

Ok, I notice that this simple addition is getting too long... should you send 

feedback I'll try to extrapolate a real essay out of it...<BR>

<BR><BR>the discount supermarket 



<BR><BR>by Curious George



<BR><BR>23 December 1998

</H2></CENTER>



<BR><BR>There is a particular chain of discount supermarkets where I live

called "food 4 less". They claim that you will save between %20 

and %50 off of the same item from a different regular supermarket.

Well, I tried shopping there once. Very first thing I noticed

(lucky me, I read +ORC's essay before coming here, thank God)

was that there was ONLY ONE entrance. The slaves were FORBIDDEN

to enter at the other door, the ONLY exit.

<BR><BR>

Now being immediately suspicious I go in with one of the

unusually large trollies. I see that I have no choice of

where to walk. So, I turn left. It turns out that the whole store

is positioned in a maze. YES! There are not normal grids of

isles, instead, the shelves are organized so that there is only one

path through the store. More than this... there are some turns that

lead to dead ends, on purpose of course.<BR> 

So, I decided to wait in the middle of the

maze -like a spider- and watch the slaves wandering up and back in

a daze. Most of them were a little apprehensive (where is the escape?). But

the soft muzik and the pretty meats and veggies made them "feel 

good". So, I noticed they would pass me with their trolly almost

empty (all of them had "huge" trolleys) and their shopping list finished. 

I thought: that's it, they are clever enough, after all, 

I won't see them again. I was 

wrong: A few minutes later, I would see them return in a daze....and

dissapear again. So, after a while; and a few more maze-crossing, I saw 

them again and again. 

Now, take notice, their trolly is QUITE FULL. Also, the shopping list is no 

longer in their hand. 

<BR><BR>

So, now that I had my items and that I had finished my obeservations, 

I decided to leave. Being persistent

I found the exit (was not so easy after all, though).

 Now, here I notice that they have many many cash

registers. Maybe %50 more than usual, even if the store was the same size

as a normal mall. All queues, on the various lines, were very small. Once you 

actually found the exit you are supposed to beggar off as quickly as possible, probably. 

I also notice there was no "express"

line for those that only bought few items. Probably an almost impossible 

and blasphemous event. Then I realized that on the way in there were only

large push trollies, no small hand basket whatsoever! You were not supposed 

to buy just a couple of things or just the things you need... you were supposed 

to FILL YOUR TROLLEY UNTIL IT BURSTS!

<BR><BR>

When i finally made it home, I examined my "fresh" products

carefully. Meat had a nice "redness" to it... while in the store. 

Yet, when I cut open the 

ground beef for dinner, it was much more "grey" inside: 

only the first 2cm of the 

meat was pink. They probably took old meat and mixed, putting some fresh 

meat ontop. This

is illegal where I live, yet they seemed to have done it. 

So, looking at my veggies, I noticed some "wax" 

on the apples. Carefully peeling off this "wax" I saw that my 'nice'  

polished apple has bruises on it. Looking at my milk, eggs, and

yogurt,  I see they are the same brand as my favourite store. This is not

unusual

in itself. However, even if according to labels the dairy was 

supposed to last for 2 weeks, the milk

was thick as cream in just one week.<BR>

I suspect therefore they bought old dairy from the usual 

supplier of my normal grocery and then somehow contrived to stamp 

false 'best before' date onto them. Else I'm seeking an explanation. 

<BR><BR>

I went back a week later to test all this in more detail. For the meats, I

"secretly" 

poked a knife into the beef (being careful of the many casino style

black

camera bubbles... supermarkets are closely watched!). 

I constated that only part of the beef was bad!

<BR><BR>

In the produce area, I did the same test. Once more, only some 

of the apples were 'waxed'. And with dairy too, only 

some of the milk was of the same brand I normally use, there ware many 

other kinds I never heard of. So, I

suspect 

that they present a mix of products: some almost stale, some fresh, 

so  that only 

at times it really happens that the slave gets real bad stuff, 

and anyway he is not supposed to realize that this is only 

happening at this "food 4 less" chain. Also, by using bad exemplars from 

a brand present on the good

store, the

slave will think that his milk from the good store went bad, not that bought 

from "food 4 

less".<BR>

By the way, on my second trip there, I did not buy anything at all. Great 

feeling of power, like a scientist in the Savana. Clerks 

were astonished to see me leave without buying anything. :)

<BR><BR>

The second time I was there I noticed that the music <U>in the main

store area</U> was soft and slow. They repeat some songs again and again, 

but most of them are new and continuously changing. These patterns would need

more thorough investigation.<BR>

Also,

there were short ads inside the music. A soft male voice tells you

about

the special %60 percent discount for an item only available today!

Lighting changes chrominance slightly from place to place. I never saw

a clerk fixing the products, but the products were always fixed. In

the

exit row, music was different! It was faster. I think there were so

many

registers so they can get people out of the store fast so they don't

realize they just bought so much that THEY DIDN'T SAVE ANY MONEY AT

ALL

off of the total purchase.

<BR><BR>

In conclusion, I am very scared of this store. I hope it doesnt become

the store model of the future. At least regular stores only suggest

with

subtle psychology what to do. They don't try to make you. I think

marketers (who are lower in my mind than even politicians and weapon

designers) have become so infatuated with their power over the masses

that they have lost any respect whatsoever for their fellow humans.

This illicit power has corrupted them and they somehow think they are

inherintly superior to the average man. I think though, that if the

trend

continues to be less hidden and try to force more from the slave, the 

slaves will start to wake from their slumber. 

Maybe I should say, I hope....

<BR><BR>

I wish you good eating for the holiday's readers!

<BR><BR>
