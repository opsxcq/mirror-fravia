---------===_masta_'s Tutorial on Win32 ASM Coding Part 1===----------

      -------==========================================----------



			     --==INTR0==--



				-[Hi!]-



After the part 0 I got some mail saying that it was a good idea to do 

a windows-based revival of the "old art" of assembly language 

programming. We all know that DOS is about to die (not many (if any) 

of us are happy about that), but unfortunately we can't change this 

fact.



		        --==WHAT IS NEEDED?==--





		1. Texteditor

		2. TASM 5.0, complete with libs, etc.

		3. Win32-API-Reference (Win32.HLP)



I assume you have basic knowledge of assemly, althought most of the 

stuff is easy to grasp.



		     --==SENSE OF THIS PROJECT==--



We want to code a "generic patcher" which is also known as a 

"Search-and-Destroy-Patcher".

Since many people may not know what to expect from a Generic-Patcher,

I want to explain it shortly. It is a patcher, which is not only able 

to patch a certain version of a program, but future versions also, if 

they are nearly the same. This is done by searching for a certain 

byte-pattern (and writing a new one) and not by patching some offset, 

which makes this kind more universal to use.

Since most likely the protection-scheme is not changed by the coder,

this bytes of this routine may have another offset-address in the 

newer (older) version, but the bytes will be the same. 

That's the trick =).



			   --==LET'S GO!==--





OK, first we think about the main structure of our program, then we 

think about which functions we use and last but not least, we write 

the program.



1. Intro           - Little intro, presented in a MessageBox

2. Open File       - Set file-handle. If file not exist -> MessageBox

3. Get Filesize

4. Allocate memory - Allocate memory equal to the filesize. 

		     If error -> MessageBox

5. Read File       - copy complete file into allocated memory

6. Search Bytes    - Determination of the offset of the bytepattern. 

		     If errors -> MessageBox

7. Set Filepointer

   to offset

8. Overwrite File  - Patch of the file. Success -> MessageBox

   with new bytes

9. Close File      - Cleanup!

   Deallocate Mem

   Quit



			  --==API-FUNCTIONS==--





- All messages will be presented by a messagebox, i.e. 'MessageBoxA'.



- For opening the file we will use the 'CreateFileA'-function, which 

  is more complex than the 'OpenFile, but also more flexible to use.



- To close we will use 'CloseHandle'.



- The filesize we get via 'GetFileSize'



- We allocate the mem with the help of 'GlobalAlloc'; set it free 

  again with 'GlobalFree'



- Logically we read the file with 'ReadFile' and write it with 

  'WriteFile'



- The Filepointer can be set with 'SetFilePointer'



- To quit we use 'ExitProcess'





        		  --==THE BYTE SEARCH==--





This is the heart of our patcher. With the help of this little routine

the target-file is searched for a byte pattern, which will be changed 

later. I will just explain it shortly, because the most you can get 

out of the code.

OK, we first load the size of the file (the alloc. memory) into ECX to

set a value for the "REPNZ"-command; also the first byte of the search-

pattern is written into AL and ESI is set to the address of the 

original values.

With 'REPNZ SCASB' the value of AL is compared to the value of the 

memory address, which EDI points to (EDI is incremented by 1). The 

'REPNZ'-command repeats the following 'SCASB' as long as either ECX=0 

or the compared values are equal (FL Z=1).

If the values are equal ECX is loaded with the length of the patch, 

EDI is decremented by 1, because the 'SCASB' already counted one byte 

ahead.

The following 'REPZ CMPSB' repeats 'CMPSB' (compares the address of 

[ESI] with the one of [EDI]) as long as either ECX=0 or the value 

differs.





			  --==THE PATCH ITSELF==--





Now quickly some stuff about the patch routine itself.

First the offset is calculated by incrementing ECX (byte-counter) by 1 

and this value we subtract from the total filesize:



- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

(FILESIZE) - (BYTES UNTIL THE END OF FILE) = ACTUAL OFFSET

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -



This value is put on the stack, as well as the file-handle to later 

CALL the function 'SetFilePointer' to set the filepointer to our offset.

After that the buffer for the written bytes (bwrite), the length of the 

patch, the offset of the new bytes and the file-handle is PUSHed and 

the API-function 'WriteFile' is CALLed.



			     --==THE SOURCE==--





Maybe a bit complex, but I guess still easy to understand =) ...

;-----------------------==END OF SOURCE==----------------------------



OK, done!

To assemble it, just run the included 'make.bat' ...





		    

		      --==A LITTLE NOTICE==--



	Until now I didn't see a reason to use include-files

	And well, the INC-files coming with TASM are not very

	complete, BUT if there is anybody out there possessing

	complete *.incs then don't hesitate to send'em to me!



			    --==END==--



OK, I think this time we did something really useful, not just a MessageBox

like in my first essay, but a real every-day-tool of a cracker.

The source can be freely used naturally and maybe there are some things you

can optimize, especially concerning the search-routine (Hi Fungus ;)), but

I think for learning-purpose it is OK.

For a little challenge: 



--> You could search for the first 4 bytes from the start





OK, I hope that my mailbox (masta_t@USA.NET) will explode soon 

(CRITICS ARE WELCOME) and I will see ya all next time ... =)  

By the way I am trying to establish an IRC-channel about these facts ...



--> #win32asm



I just hope there are enough people interested in this stuff and also in

giving their knowledge to others.
