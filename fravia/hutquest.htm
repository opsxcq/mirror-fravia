> THE QUEST

>

> Building the launch pad

>

> Popular legend tells us that Richard the Lionheart undertook a quest to

> free the Holy Lands of infidels who were threatening the Holy City yet the

> annals of history tell us a different story.

>

> After plundering his way through the eastern end of the Meditteranean, he

> joined others who were conducting a seige on the city of Acra. When the

> city eventually fell, Richard held the survivors to ransom and did a deal

> for payment of the ransom and the possession of a religious relic called

> the "True Cross".

>

> When the ransom did not arrive on time, Richard had the 2700 survivors

> massacred without regard to the difficulties in raising the ransom or the

> agreement that he had made with his opponent, the revered Salah al-Din.

>

> History shows us that Salah al-Din (Saladin) eventually freed the area of

> the barbarians who had occupied the country for about eighty years and was

> perhaps the only one who ever took possession of Jerusalem that did not

> leave the place knee deep in dead bodies.

>

> Legend has it that Salah al-Din used to drag the relic through the streets

> as revenge for the massacre of the survivors of Acra. The programmer who

> comes looking for the lost power of low level tools also undertakes a quest

> that is demanding and subject to the distortions of popular legend.

>

> Popular legend has it that you no longer need to use low level tools and

> techniques to write software, just know how to use a mouse to draw your

> interface and know how to paste the right bit of example code into the

> right window and you have a program that will compile just by pushing the

> button.

>

> The problems from this approach are twofold, it works OK but the things

> that can be done that way are of little use without having to write extra

> code and it is here where these RAD environments often fall down. The other

> of course is the size of compiled file before it has any application code

> written into it.

>

> The best available tools to undertake the quest are the compilers that are

> still available from different vendors.

>

> Both Microsoft and Borland have genuine C compilers hidden beneath the GUI

> front ends. VB users will have to look to a small Californian company called

> Power Basic for a basic compiler called PBDLL50 that has enough grunt to do

> the job.

>

> While all of the compilers mentioned will write inline assembler, the

> capacity to write direct API front ends is an area where any decent

> compiler earns its living in 32 bit windows. The other thing that is

> imperative is the 12 meg M$ helpfile called WIN32.HLP. Its sheer size tends

> to make it a conceptual nigthtmare but it where the action is in APIs.

>

> This presents some difficulty for programmers with a different background

> to C as windows APIs are fundamentally C function calls. With the compilers

> available, C works with APIs as native functions and the dialect of basic

> has the correct data types to do the same.

>

> Programming in direct APIs is a very efficient way to write code in terms of

> both size and speed so in this area there is not much reason to write the

> call directly in assembler, this comes when you are writing application

> code.

>

>   A common function like,

>

>   rv = SendMessage( hWnd, WM_PAINT, hDC, 0)

>

>   is translated to something like,

>

>         push 0

>         push hDC

>         push WM_PAINT

>         push hWnd

>         call SendMessage

>         mov  rv, eax

>

>   by most compilers.

>

> Noting the reverse order of parameter passing with STDCALL which pushes the

> last parameter first back down to the first parameter last so that when the

> call arrives down in the guts of M$ in noddy land (Win Doze) the parameters

> are popped of the stack in the right order.

>

> Operating system overview.

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> In comparison to 16 bit windows, Win 95 has actually simplified similar

> capacity coding. There is no longer any need for the multi-instance code at

> startup as this is handled by the operating system. There are additional

> styles that can be used by calling the extended version of CreateWindowEx

> which frame the client area without the need to write a graphics routine

> to do it.

>

> To provide the operating system with the services needed to do the

> additional interface design, there are additional functions that did not

> exist in the old version that make interface design much easier for the

> application programmer.

>

> The stumbling block for most contemplating an API front end is the startup

> code necessary to get it going. There is a simple solution to the problem,

> cheat, have a look around in the samples directory that came with the

> compiler for a project with a name something like GENERIC or HELLOWIN or

> whatever you can find.

>

> For the basic gang, there is a generic template attached at the end of this

> document that does the same thing. Particularly for those with a basic

> background, using a compiler simplifies the API calls that you will make.

>

> With a windows header file loaded, all of the API calls can be made without

> the usual messing around associated with declarations in VB.

>

> Hatching the plot

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> A WinMain function is different to other functions that you write, you don't

> call it, windows does. It supplies the function parameters to the

> application for its internal use.

> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance,      // handle to current instance

>                    HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,  // unused parameter in win 95

>                    LPSTR lpCmdLine,          // pointer to command line

>                    int nCmdShow);            // show state of window

> {

>   code ...

>   code ...

>   code ...

>     return (msg.wParam);

> }

> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Don't be concerned about the names of the data types, if you look in the

> windows header file, the four data types are defined as DWORD, DWORD, DWORD

> & DWORD. Takes a lot of the mystery out of it. The important thing is to

> know the size of the data and to use the types that the compiler requires.

>

> The next function is another that you do not call, it is the WndProc

> function. You advise windows where its address is and windows sends the

> messages that are associated with the window to it. No prizes for guessing

> the data sizes for the four parameters passed to it, DWORD, DWORD, DWORD &

> DWORD. Even though the third parameter is called [ wParam ] it is 4 bytes

> long, a 32 bit DWORD size data type.

> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT message,

>                          WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)

>

>         switch (message) {

>                 case WM_COMMAND:   etc .......

>

>

>     return (DefWindowProc(hWnd, message, wParam, lParam));

> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> This function gives you the capacity to intercept messages as they are

> being sent to the window and respond according to your application's

> requirements. Any that you do not need to touch are passed back to windows

> which does the default processing for you.

>

> The rest of building your launch pad for miniature skyrocket applications

> is simply a matter of calling the right set of functions. From your header

> file, you set up a WNDCLASSEX data type in whatever you language requires,

>

>   in C,

>     WNDCLASSEX  wc;

>

>   in basic,

>     LOCAL wc as WndClassEx

>

>   and you put the following in your WinMain function. This creates a CLASS

> for your window that is needed by the CreateWindow function.

>

> The example below is in Basic.

> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

>     szClassName      = "My_Launch_Pad_Class"

>

>     wc.cbSize        = SIZEOF(wc)

>     wc.style         = %CS_HREDRAW or %CS_VREDRAW or _

>                        %CS_BYTEALIGNCLIENT or %CS_BYTEALIGNWINDOW

>     wc.lpfnWndProc   = CODEPTR(WndProc)

>     wc.cbClsExtra    = 0

>     wc.cbWndExtra    = 0

>     wc.hInstance     = hInstance

>     wc.hIcon         = LoadIcon(hInstance,"BIGICON")

>     wc.hCursor       = LoadCursor(%NULL,ByVal %IDC_ARROW)

>     wc.hbrBackground = GetStockObject(%LTGRAY_BRUSH)

>     wc.lpszMenuName  = %NULL

>     wc.lpszClassName = VarPtr(szClassName)

>     wc.hIconSm       = LoadIcon(hInstance,"SMALLICO")

> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

>

> The [ wc.lpfnWndProc ] member of the WNDCLASSEX structure is where you tell

> windows where your message handling function is. In C it is written,

>

>         wc.lpfnWndProc = (WNDPROC)WndProc;

>

> Next you register the class,

>

>         return RegisterClass(&wc);

>

> then you create your window. ( In Basic )

>

>   hWnd = CreateWindowEx(%WS_EX_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW, _
