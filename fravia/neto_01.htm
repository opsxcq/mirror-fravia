Well well, old timelock never dies... "Sales Agent" what for an ugly commercial 

oriented name. We'll have to build our own 'Sales antiagents' bots... Hey, why not? C'mon, let's have 

our "freedom agents"  

or -even better- "poetry agents"! I mean: what about our own simple perl robots roaming around and 

nuking automatically -for instance- all web sites where 'commerce' dominates and where 

there are no rhimes and no poetry at all? :-)<br>Ok, I'm dreaming (am I? :-) anyway

<p>

Hello, HCUkers. My name is Miguel Neto. Beeing the less than average cracker that I am, and

therefore

don't having to fear censors, I don't see why I should use a nicknname.

 I am

going

to introduce you to another commercial protection scheme,

"tl32v20.dll

style".

This one is called rsagnt32.dll. As you will see, it is hardly more

difficult to

beat than the more widespread <A HREF=

"javascript:if(confirm('http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/-a href=  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/-a href='" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/-a href=" http://www.fravia.org/timelock.htm">TimeLock</A>.

<P>

The main program I am aware of that uses this "Sales Agent" is

Dreamweawer, a wiespread web-design and site-administration utility.<BR>

I apologize for the size of the target, I know it is very big, but most

commercial

applications are (IE4, NETSCAPE4, Norton's recent products, etc...).<BR>

Anyway,

it

shouldn't take all too much to download, even on a slow

connection, once you have ftpgetted it from the web (alternatively you'll 

find it on many magazine covers published in the period April-July 1998).

<P>

Even though this target proved very easy to defeat, I thougt it would be

worth

sending

my essay to fravia+ because of the protection it uses, which has been 

made by a third party

company.<BR>

You will probably encounter the same scheme in many other products.<BR> 

Ok, enough rambling, let's crack!

The version I am using is 1.0, because I already had it on my hard

disk. I don't

know if more recent versions still have the same protection scheme. The

setup

file for version 1.0 is 5.5 mb and is called dreamweaver.exe

<P>

First of all, install Dreamweawer. The installation asks you for a

serial number,

you don't have to enter one just yet. Ok, let's try and register it.

After

searching for a while, we conclude that there is no obvious way to

register

("This product is using a DEMO serial and does not need to be

registered").<BR>

The only protection appears to be the 30 day trial. Ok, so set your

clock one

month

forward to see what happpens. There you go! Dreamweaver expired! Now

reset

your clock

to it's original state and restart Dreamweaver. Doh! I doesn't work!<BR>

Dreamweaer

is gone

forever, at least until you crack it... This must be one of those

"diode protections"

+ORC mentioned to us...<BR>

No matter, we won't go that way... Cracking a time trial is never a

*clean*

crack,

the program is never 100% complete that way, you never know what can

happen 1 month

from later. So, start Dreamweaver and select buy. Quite a fancy screen

we

have here.<BR>

Doesn't look like it is really a part of Dreamweaer proper does it? No references to the

program or

to Macromedia whatsoever... Let's see where does this beautiful screen

live...<BR>

Fire up Soft-ice and set a breakpoint on getdlgitemtexta and on

getwindowtexta.<BR>

Enter some stuff to fill out the fields and press enter. Soft-ice fires

up in

Kernel32 (the dll where dlgitem and windowtext live), press F12 to go

back to

whatever

called that function, and you see that it rsagnt.<BR>

A new kid on the

block! Using

the Find feature of windows95, we discover that the correspondent dll

is on

Dreamweaver's directory (At least Macromedia had the decency of not

concealing 

it in the

windows/system). Let's disassemble the babe! If you haven't prepared

your

drink and

set up your music yet, don't bother, because we are practically

finished...<BR>

Once Wdasm has finished disassembling, go to string references. Check

them.<BR>

Examine

each and every one of them. This is the most difficult part of the

cracking, even

if

it is always pretty easy. You will eventually find a  "Thank You", which is

not bad at all as 'fishing point'... 

but there is also a "This is a Demo. Unlocking", which is much better.<BR>

Double

click

that reference and you will end up here:

<PRE>

:10003F53 8B9C2484020000          mov ebx, dword ptr [esp+00000284]

:10003F5A 6A40                    push 00000040



* Possible StringData Ref from Data Obj ->"SalesAgent Demo"

                                  |

:10003F5C 688C500210              push 1002508C



* Possible StringData Ref from Data Obj ->"This is a demo. Unlocking"

                                  |

:10003F61 6858500210              push 10025058</PRE>



So, if at 3DF6 the program calls this, that means that it pretty much

knows that

everything is set, that the user has payed his 269$ (Oh my!), and that it

can go on

with the unlocking. So, let's see what happens at EDF6. Scroll up a bit

and you

will see:<PRE>

* Referenced by a Jump at Address:10003DDA(C)

|

:10003DF1 8B742448                mov esi, dword ptr [esp+48]

:10003DF5 56                      push esi

:10003DF6 E845010000              call 10003F40</PRE>



Haha! A conditional jump! So, if at 3DDA the program breaks, than the

program

will

probably be registered! Fire up soft-ice, recreate or enable the

breakpoint at

getdlgitemtexta and select BUY from the Dreamweaver nag. Enter some text

and press

enter. Soft-Ice will break and you will be able to set the breakpoint at

10003DDA

on rsagnt. Ok, now clear all breakpoints exept the last one, fill in

the fields, and

continue. We now have another screen asking us information about out

credit

card,

just enter a bunch of keys for the credit card number, and some

balloney info

about

yourself, and you are ready to go. There is no need to check for credit

card

info at

this point, since you are still offline, so if you enter 13 numbers the

program will

probably accept them. If not, just enter your expired credit card info,

don't

worry,

we'll never go online with it. Press enter and voilý! Soft-ice breaks

at the

conditional jump. Change the flag and the program will jump. Now, if you

remember

correctly, right before the "Unlocking" string showed up, there was a

conditional

jump, at 3F51. So we will have to trace the function and change this

flag to. At

this point, you can press F5 and you are ready to go! There is no need

to

patch

since the program only checks this call once! The program is unlocked.

<P>

Now we start Dreamweaver, thinking that we are registered, only to

discover

that

there is another serial number to be entered. Before I explaine this

protection,

there is something you must know. When I began writting this tutorial,

I said to

myself: "Miguel, you are just a begginer! So don't go around

criticizing the way

Dreamweaver or the protection is made, just crack! You'll end up making

a fool

of

yourself!" But now I find it impossible to contain myself. Just

disassemble

Dreamweaver yourself

 and you will see what I mean; God know why, Macromedia already gave you

the first

letters of the code, DWW100-. Now, if you look at the references, you

will find

a

nice string like this: DWW100-07785-53546-55079.<P>"It can't be"-you

shout.<BR> It

is.<BR>

It seems that the boys at Macromedia wanted to give us a taste of their

protection

skills, as well as a motif as why they chose this commercial

protection. It makes

me

laugh! THIS is the way a 269$ software is protected... Now, level with

me, you would not have

found yourself a more stupid way to protect than to <U>hardcore<U> the serial into the

file itself would have

you?<BR>

HA HA AH... My tummy hurts... My back hurts... ha ha ha...

Thank god this tutorial is finished!!

</P>

<PRE>

You now have another weapon in your arsenal, the knowledge to crack

SalesAgent,

let's hope more and more software companies decide to buy this

protection.

Protections are getting easier each day my friend, people are getting

more

stupid

each day, if you don't go with the flow, if you don't forget that

knowledge is the

Ultimate Weapon, we have nothing the fear, quite on the contratry...



I would like to thank +Fravia for all his efforts. His site is the only

one in the

web that rises cracking to an art form, and I can only hope to become

half

the cracker he is.
