Cracking  &quot;blacklisted&quot; Hex/Text Editors</FONT></CENTER>



<B>NOTE</B>: I know I'm not the only one to have cracked this - <A href="ueditcrk.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ueditcrk.htm">Aesculapius</A>  

(hi!) and others have also done the same - but I saw there was a new 

+HCU section on hex editors, so I thought I'd contribute and hope it helps 

someone anyway...



<B>Tools needed:</B>



SoftICE 3 for Windows 95

W32Dasm (I used 8.9, but any version should do)

A hex editor (eg UltraEdit itself :-)





UltraEdit is a very useful text/hex editor with a variety of nice  features

(eg syntax highlighting, macros, spell checking etc). It's  particularly

useful when searching large text files (much faster than any commercial 

and bloated word processor) such as dead listings, and can also be used 

to patch your target on the fly!



UltraEdit-32 4.40a (the versions are constantly changing) may be 

downloaded from: <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#77 tppabs='" tppabs="http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#77 tppabs=" http://www.idmcomp.co/"m">http://www.idmcomp.com</A> 

or <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#78 tppabs='" tppabs="http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#78 tppabs=" http://www.ultraedit.co/"m"> http://www.ultraedit.com</A>



I've been using various versions of UltraEdit for quite a while now, 

and I have cracked earlier versions using a number of different approaches. 

Fravia has written one very interesting <A href="ultrae2.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ultrae2.htm">essay</A> on using Borland's Resource 

Workshop as a cracking tool, in which he shows how to crack a version of 

UltraEdit using only the BRW. Anyway, the other day I downloaded the latest 

version of UltraEdit (4.40a) and installed it. I had rather foolishly lost all 

my cracking notes relating to the previous versions of UltraEdit, so in 

order to crack it I would have to start from a 'clean slate'. The 

install progr informs you that the serial codes used in the last version of 

UltraEdit are no longer valid, and that you'll have to contact the distributor to 

get an updated serial number. This meant that grabbing any old serial off 

the Internet would not have worked (as if I would entertain such a lame idea in the 

first place).



So to work. First of all I tried to take a look at the target with 

the BRW. This ingenious program can often reveal to you many hidden 

surprises concealed within modern 'bloatware'. But arrgghhh! It does not work :-( 

The BRW informs us that it has encountered an unknown file format - so 

we're going to have to crack this properly.



Before attempting to crack a target, it is *essential* that you apply a

little 'Zen' (courtesy of +ORC), and *think* about how the protection scheme

must work. Observe the target in action, read the docs and help files

carefully, and try out the registration options, making a note of the

messages you get (eg 'Invalid code' etc). In the case of UltraEdit, upon

starting the program, we are shown a a delayed nag screen which is shown

while UltraEdit loads and for a few more seconds thereafter. 

This nag screen tells us the number of days left within our 45-day evaluation 

period, and offers us the chance to input a registration code. If you choose to 

input a registration code you will find that, rather unusually, a message box 

is displayed telling us that UltraEdit will need to be restarted in order to

validate the code. If you look in the UltraEdit directory, you will very

quickly see that there is a file named 'UEDIT32.REG', which contains 

the name and number you input, eg:



[UserID]

User Name=ReZiDeNt

User Code=1212121212121212



So we can deduce that UltraEdit reads the name/code combination from the

'UEDIT32.REG' file at startup (use the excellent 'FileMon' utility if  you

want to make certain of this) - it then checks the code and if it is 

invalid, the 45-day time limit nag is shown.



Now, when I first got this program I was in such a hurry to use it that I

didn't bother to investigate it properly; I simply set a breakpoint on

GetLocalTime and started from there, cracking the 45-day time 

limitation. But later when I had more time I realised that this was a 

sorry state of affairs, I simply had to crack it properly and/or 

generate a working name and code combination. So I disassembled it 

using W32Dasm, and took a look at the String Data References. Well, 

well, what do we see? If you look down right toward the end of the 

list of string references you will come across quite a few strings 

that look like user names (eg 'tHATDUDE', 'Kermu!' etc) and one that 

looks very much like a code ('X(wL13G+zW,d9r&amp;A')! This program

seems to incorporate yet another <FONT color="red">'black list'</FONT> protection scheme, 

whereby the handles of well-known crackers (such as 'tHATDUDE') and 

widely-distributed serial numbers are 'black listed'. If you enter 

'tHATDUDE' as your user name, or 'X(wL13G+zW,d9r&amp;A' as your serial 

number, you will find that upon restarting UltraEdit, 25 days have 

been subtracted from your trial period...



Anyway, back to the crack...searching through the disassembled listing for

strings such as 'Thank you for supporting Shareware' or 'UltraEdit 45 Day

Evaluation time expired!!!!' doesn't work, as you'll find hundreds of

possible references. To do this crack we need to locate where 

UltraEdit reads the name/code combination from the 'UEDIT32.REG' 

file. The following function is used by UltraEdit to retrieve the name

and code:





/*

GetPrivateProfileString



The GetPrivateProfileString function retrieves a string from the specified

section in an initialization file. This function is provided for

compatibility with 16-bit Windows-based applications. Win32-based

applications should store initialization information in the registry jungle.



DWORD GetPrivateProfileString(



    LPCTSTR lpAppName,	// points to section name

    LPCTSTR lpKeyName,	// points to key name

    LPCTSTR lpDefault,	// points to default string

    LPTSTR lpReturnedString,	// points to destination buffer

    DWORD nSize,        // size of destination buffer

    LPCTSTR lpFileName 	// points to initialization filename

   );	



*/



OK, so we set a breakpoint on GetPrivateProfileStringA ('bpx

GetPrivateProfileStringA') and run UltraEdit. SoftICE will break and 

you should see the following



* Reference To: KERNEL32.GetPrivateProfileStringA, Ord:0112h

                                  |

:00405CA6 FF150C0C4A00  Call dword ptr [004A0C0C]

:00405CAC 8D862A020000  lea eax, dword ptr [esi+22A] ;load username address into eax



Type 'db eax' to see the user name you entered. Now set a breakpoint 

on the memory location where the name is stored (we want to try and 

see how/where it is manipulated/compared):



bpm eax



Now remove the breakpoint on GetPrivateProfileStringA and let 

UltraEdit run. SoftICE will snap *three* times - each of these 

three times the name is being manipulated and copied etc. 

IGNORE these for now and wait until the *fourth* (and final) 

time SoftICE snaps. 

Now press 'P RET' to get back to the code that called this 

routine. You'll see the following:



:00405697 E8D4900300   call 0043E770 ; this is where SoftICE snaps

:0040569C 59           pop ecx

:0040569D 85C0         test eax, eax

:0040569F 59           pop ecx

:004056A0 7520         jne 004056C2 ; jumps from here...



* Referenced by a Jump at Address:004056A0(C)

:004056C2 85DB          test ebx, ebx ; to here!

:004056C4 743C          je 00405702

:004056C9 50            push eax

                                                    ;code you entered

:004056CD 50            push eax

:004056CE E89D900300    call 0043E770 ;compares the codes

:004056D4 85C0          test eax, eax

:004056D6 59            pop ecx

:004056D7 741E    ***** je 004056F7   ;jump nice buyer!

:004056D9 8D8540FFFFFF  lea eax, dword ptr [ebp-00C0] ;load alternative code

:004056DF 50            push eax

:004056E0 8D4580        lea eax, dword ptr [ebp-80]   ;load(cleaned) 

                                                      ;code you entered

:004056E3 50            push eax

:004056E4 E887900300    call 0043E770 ;compare the codes

:004056E9 59            pop ecx

:004056EA 85C0          test eax, eax

:004056EC 59            pop ecx

:004056ED 7408          je 004056F7   ;jump nice buyer!

:004056EF 8935088D4900  mov dword ptr [00498D08], esi

:004056F5 EB0B          jmp 00405702  ; else beggar-off



Interesting! So there are actually *two* valid code for the user name 

that you entered: one that consists of jumbles ASCII characters and one 

that looks more like a traditional registration code. The first valid 

code is located at [ebp-40], while the second code is locate

at [ebp-00C0]. So to find a valid name/code combination, simply 

enter your name (over 6 chars) and enter any number. 

Then break above and type:



db ebp-40            ; this will show the first valid code

db ebp-00C0          ; this will show the second valid code



Doing this we can see that valid name/code combinations are:



Name: ReZiDeNt

Code: Y5?k!#:G;}cR6$/C



Or



Name: ReZiDeNt

Code: JZCBXAXR63921627



Alternatively, we can also patch the target to make it accept any 

name/code. Simply replace



:004056D7 741E    je 004056F7   ;jump if valid code



with



:004056D7 EB1E    jmp 004056F7  ;jump always!





search for:   0x59741E8D8540FFFFFF

replace with: 0x59EB1E8D8540FFFFFF

                  ^^





BTW, remember I said that the name/code is stored in a file named

'UEDIT32.REG'? It is also stored in the 'UEDIT32.INI' file located 

in the Windows directory. 

Interestingly, you can't simply rip the name/code out of

these files - the code in encrypted, so that if you just copy the 

code out of the INI or REG file and try to enter it into your own 

copy, it will not work. This was probably intended to deter lamer

from copying codes, but it offers little protection against us 

+crackers! :-)



Keep cracking!
