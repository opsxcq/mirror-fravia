<I>Well, well: +Xoanon is back with another 'cracking exploit'! This excellent italian 

cracker delivers -once more- a very good essay, that will convince any 

shareware protector, once more, about the 

old truth: ready-made protections are NOT to be used, no, no, no!<BR>BTW: 

+Xoanon attitude towards our reversing science and towards 

the other sex is, IMHO much more emulating worth than his curious 

attitude towards maggots </I>:-)<BR>And, I love +Xoanon's 'tradition' of presenting 'universal cracks', wish 

many more contributors would do just that, instead of concentrating on a single target... 

and I enjoy the fact that he's building on Marigold's (good) previous work: this's the 

whole point of our work: team working in order to solve generical puzzles and to 

develop software protection - and deprotection - into a science in its own rights!<HR></CENTER>

<P><!-- PASTE HERE YOUR INTRODUCTION -->Hi again Fravia+! 

Probably you can't believe your eyes....

another essay from +Xoa after less than a month! :) Am i mad maybe? 

Or i've run out of women and fun in this hot summer and i have 

nothing better instead of staying here sitting at the PC writing 

essays ? Who knows.... ehehhehe :) xOANON ran out of women... 

impossible :) I just found some free time, that's all :) See, in reality &lt;==

xOANON is actually not a +cracker, he's a +playboy ! (Don't care too much of this rambling, please 

it's very hot down here and this grasp our minds, we all get a little bit mad :)</P>

<P>Anyway... this time i'll present to your readers another readymade protection,

very very crappy in my opinion. Nothing compared to VBox and

Timelock, they are wrappers... This instead act only as a

&quot;crypter&quot;. But you will understand better reading the

essay.</P>



<P>Another thing i want to say: the programmer (maybe knowing how

fool the protection is) have released IntelliSecure R2 as

freeware (you can find it on <A

href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/www.dataet.com/products/isr2/index.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because the server reports that this file cannot be found.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/www.dataet.com/products/isr2/index.html'" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/www.dataet.com/products/isr2/index.html">http:/www.dataet.com/products/isr2</A>,

get it coz it's required for complete understanding of the

protection). This is good, at least he doesn't ask anything for

his (crappy) work. PreviewSoftware (VBox &amp; Timelock) asks

instead thousands $$$ for their protections.... bah. Shareware

programmers please , -OPEN YOUR EYES- !</P>

and apply it to an executable file of your choice. After applied,

you notice some other files appeared in the directory. They are:</P>



<P>1) <STRONG>EULA1.RTF</STRONG> &lt;== End user license

agreement 1 (don't care of it)<BR>

2) <STRONG>EULA2.RTF</STRONG> &lt;== End user license agreement 2

(don't care of it)<BR>

3) <STRONG>REGISTER.RTF</STRONG> &lt;== Registration form(don't

care of it)<BR>

4) <STRONG>CAPTIONS.DAT</STRONG> &lt;== Used for the localization

of the Intellisecure module (don't care of it)<BR>

5) <STRONG>REPORT.TXT</STRONG> &lt;=== Just a report file which

contains number of executions of the file, state

(locked/unlocked), etc... Don't care of it too.<BR>

6) <STRONG>xxxxxx.xxx</STRONG> &lt;==== The key created using

Intellisecure Lock Configuration utility after the lock. In the

intention of the programmer, this must kept only by the producer

of the locked software and used in combination with the USER-ID

given by the locked module to obtain a valid serial number....

Amazing :) But don't care of it too.....<BR>

7) <STRONG>ISR2RT.DAT </STRONG>&lt;== Interesting<BR>

8) <STRONG>xxxxx.EXE</STRONG> &lt;=== Your .EXE file ....

hmmm.... it's length is changed... what the hell is happened?

It's packed? It's crypted? It's wrapped with something ? We'll

see later...<BR>

</P>



<P>(<STRONG>xxxxxx</STRONG> = names you choose)</P>



<P>Let's start thinking now.... we notice immediately ISR2RT.DAT

have **THE SAME** length of your original file. What does it

means? <BR>

Easy.... IntelliSecure simply does this: Encrypt your file,

rename it to ISR2RT.DAT then create a loader with the same name

of your .EXE file. This loader is universal (always same

structure and same length of 371633 bytes) and it's used to

control the time/executions expiration. So what i tought in the

beginning was to make an &quot;universal crack&quot; for it,

according to my tradition of universal cracks as for Timelock and

VBox. Very easy.....</P>



<P>Just load your locked .EXE, choose &quot;Unlock

Software&quot;, enter a name (min. 6 char) and an unlocking code

you want. Now enter in SoftICE, put a BPX on HMEMCPY and click on

&quot;Unlock Application&quot;. You will land after various PRETs

and stepping in this code:</P>



<P><STRONG>{ At this point, a result mask is already computed

from your name/serial combination }</STRONG></P>



<P>

mov eax, dword ptr [eax+00000264]<BR>

call 13AD4<BR>

mov eax, dword ptr [ebp-48]<BR>

mov al, byte ptr [eax+05]<BR>

xor byte ptr [ebp-1A], al<BR>

cmp bl, byte ptr [ebp-0E] &lt;== <STRONG>start comparing</STRONG> <BR>

jne 35355 &lt;=== <STRONG>are you trying to crack my routine ? ma per cortesia...... SHUT UP!</STRONG>

<BR>......</P>



<P>There are some other JNE simply avoiding them we land here</P>



<P>lea edx, dword ptr [ebp-4C] &lt;=== <STRONG>here starts the unlocking routine</STRONG><BR>

xor eax, eax<BR>

E883D9FCFF call 027C4<BR>

mov eax, dword ptr [ebp-4C]<BR>

lea edx, dword ptr [ebp-44]<BR>

call 05C44<BR>

lea eax, dword ptr [ebp-44]<BR>

mov edx, 35484<BR>

call 0350C<BR>

mov eax, dword ptr [ebp-44]<BR>

..........................</P>



<P>Nothing more to say, just change the JNE 35355 into JMP 34E37 

will do the work without wasting time to analyze

the serial routine. And this work fine, the program is correctly

decrypted and the ISR2 screen will not appear anymore. As i said,

since the loader <U>is universal</U>, you can do an universal patch

which change at offset 213469 (dec) the JNE 35355 in JMP 34E37

and this will work with every IntelliSecured program. <BR>

<STRONG>NB</STRONG>: Loader is universal means it has the same

structure but it's not completely the same in every program. This

means you must do a simple patch like &quot;Enter IntelliSecured

filename: &quot;, you can't obviously use the same loader for

every IntelliSecured program.</P>



<P>Just this prove the weakness of this protection... The file is

decrypted simply changing a jump, no other checks are made after

the program is executed again. For a weird case, i noticed (bug

in ISR2) the unlocked program sometimes just load then exit

immediatly if it resides in the same directory as the ISR2

package is installed... bah :) But i can assure you this crack would

works every time (i tried many times).</P>



<HR>



<P>After this funny &quot;prologue&quot; about the weakness of

this protection, i start my Marigold emulator and i present you

the true essay: (NDB: hey Fravia+, why the hell did you accept this

guy in the HCU... he's totally mad!) :)</P>



<P align="center"><FONT size="6">IntelliSecure R2: Virginity

restored<BR>

</FONT>by xOANON [UCF/CLASS] powered with Marigold Emulator</P>



<P align="left">Hi guys! It's me again (xOANINO) this time in

Marigold (TM) emulation. As xOANON i couldn't do better than a

simple universal patch.... but with my brand,new,amazing Marigold

(TM) emulator i can go further: Virginity restoration!</P>



<P align="left">First of all, why virginity restoration if the

program is already unlocked with the universal crack? Simple: i

don't like the loader, and since the original executable is only

crypted, why waste our precious HD space with 300+ kbytes of

loader, stupid .RTF,.DAT and .TXT files? Just throw'em out!</P>



<P align="left">Well, light another cigarette now and start

thinking: the IRS2RT.DAT must be accessed somewhere by the

loader, to be decrypted. So, load it in our HexEditor and write

down the first few bytes... just locate them in memory when it's

accessed. Then, lock another file with IntelliSecure, run it, set

a BPX CREATEFILEA (used to access the file) and choose

&quot;Continue Execution&quot; from the IntelliSecure screen.</P>



<P align="left">Once located when it pushes ISR2RT.DAT as the

filename before the call to CREATEFILEA, set another BPX on

READFILE and..... bingo! You'll land here (as always, i will not show

you the relevant codelocations, you should be able to trace and

locate them yourself, on your own legally obtained copy of 

this ineffective protection using SoftICE):</P>

<P align="left">Pheeeeeew.... it took really a long to me to

write all this :) But we haven't finished yet.... It's time for

another cigarette? bah..... yes :) <BR>

Now, we have 99% of the things needed to code a decrypter. Only

thing we miss is the magic table... it's always the same for all

the locked files ? Well, i tried and ... no, the programmer was

so smart to change it everytime (wow ! :)). <BR>

So... Where this magic table is located ? It's something about

the key file created by the IntelliSecure Lock Configuration

utility ? again, NO!<BR>

</P>



<P align="left">(what the hell xOA.... tell us where that crap magic table is!!!!) <BR>

</P>



<P align="left">Ehehehehhe.... calm down :) Since i haven't had

better ideas, i've written down the bytes found <A href="#[ebp-09]">here</A> and 

started to search them inside the

files we have handy : the loader and the RS2RT.DAT . Surprisingly

(how stupid commercial programmers are.....) <U>they are hardcoded even without

encryption</U> in the loader at offset 371200 (dec).<BR>

Trying locking other files, produced the same results.... the

magic table is ALWAYS stored in the loader at such offset. <BR>

</P>



<P align="left">So guys, now we have all for the decrypter. Here

is the Delphi code (you may say it's an overbloated language, but

i like it a lot... so don't bug me! :)<BR>Of course this decrypter has been 

written and is being published only in order to demonstrate how utterly useless are this kind of 

protection schemes, try it out onto the target and/or modify and ameliorate 

it if you find it worth...</P>



<P align="left"><STRONG>{ this obviously need his forms to

work... so don't think you can use it only by

cutting&amp;pasting}</STRONG></P>

<P>Finally... it tooks me like 3 hours to write this essay ! :)

Hope you liked it... and again shareware programmers &quot;OPEN

YOUR EYES&quot; ! Ask crackers if you don't know how to code a

decent protection, but please don't give your money to those

vampires! Hope this is the last time i write an essay on

readymade protections but..... as we always knew... stupid's mothers

are always pregnant :))</P>
