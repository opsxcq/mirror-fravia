This essay is a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; introduction to Windows 95 reverse 

engineering, it requires almost NO knowledge of windows programming, and a 

low to  

moderate knowledge of assembler coding. If you are already a good 

software reverse engineer this essay may disappoint you, being a little 

too much on the elementary side, yet I believe that a good comprehension of the basic of this trade is the main secret for advanced reverse 

engineering.<BR> </CENTER></I><BR><HR><BR>

<FONT size="+2"><B>Introduction</B></FONT><BR>

You may have already read the short essay (divided in two parts) that 

I published one year ago, reverse engineering Filemanager for Windows 3.1. Since we 

are all now dealing mostly with Windows 95 programs (it's not our choice 

- alas - but a Micro$oft's imposition that everybody accepts, against 

any sound logic :-) it suits us well to examine the &quot;deep&quot; structure 

of filemon.exe, Version 2.0, by By Mark Russinovich 

and Bryce Cogswell, a pretty useful program, released with its c source code at 

the beginning of the year. You may want to download also the LAST version of this 

good tool (version 3.0), released in July, at <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.ntinternals.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.ntinternals.com/'" tppabs="http://www.ntinternals.com/">http://www.ntinternals.com</A>, 

where you'll find also its companion utility regmon.exe and the Windows NT versions 

of both tools with complete c++ source code. Yet for this essay download from 

my site <U><B>version 2</B></U> of <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"><A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/filsrc.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/filsrc.zip'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/filsrc.zip">filemon.exe</A> with its source code, this is all what you'll need.<BR>

<BR>As usual, when you start a cracking session, first of all run the program, try all  its options (there are not many options inside this target) and, last 

but not least, 

print the complete 

C source code (15 &quot;A4&quot; sheets).

Since we have already the C source code of this program this lesson 

will be a &quot;false&quot; reverse engineering exercise: we are not going to 

find anything hidden or new, nor many secret tricks in here... yet I 

believe that many of you will find pretty useful our work 

below, since analogous structures will more or less be present inside 

<B>UNKNOWN</B> code, inside other targets, that you'll try to reverse engineer on your 

own.<BR>Another (very) interesting point in this program is its use of a virtual 

device driver (VXD) for the filtering of all file system accesses... VXD reverse 

engineering is a branch in its own rights, as you will see.<BR>Here you go: all

We'll reverse engineer two files: filemon.exe and filevxd.vxd. We'll begin with filemon.exe. The reverse engineering of this program will be COMPLETE, since its various parts will be useful -for you- in order to learn some of the different aspects and techniques (and tricks) of our trade. Be patient and wade slowly through the code of this target, I'll keep you on the right path.<BR> 'Dead listing' reverse engineering, as +ORC calls it, is a slow &quot;puzzle solving&quot; process: the intellectual challenge can be extremely interesting, btw.<BR>We will NEVER use Winice in this essay, as it is NOT NECESSARY to use our powerful debugger to understand EVERYTHING a target does, as you'll see reading this essay.

<HR size="2" width="22%" align="left"><BR>

<FONT size="+2"><B>Elementary must know, the SaveFile approach</B></FONT><BR>

<BR>

<BR>Some elementary MUST KNOW that you should head before starting a cracking session:<BR>

At the beginning there are no names... only a sea of numbers, hundred of 

different locations... that's your target &quot;in the wild&quot;, roaming around with unnamed procedures, before you tame it to clarity.<BR>

Soon some little islands will appear... their form still indeterminate... slowly  you'll understand what some procedures of your target (should)  do... for instance here 

in filemon (as in almost all programs you'll disassemble) it's pretty easy to 

individuate the &quot;FileSaving&quot; function, using simple search masks inside the 

dead listing.<BR>

Searching you'll quickly get to this part of your dead listing:<PRE>

:00401CF3 C744244804824000        mov [esp + 48], 00408204 ;&quot;Save File Info...&quot;

:00401CFB C7442454FC814000        mov [esp + 54], 004081FC ;&quot;*.fil&quot;</PRE>

Now just dead list &quot;back&quot;, to the beginning of this function:<PRE>

:00401C20 81EC7C060000            sub esp, 0000067C  ;correct stack</PRE>

Since this function starts at  :00401C20, we can at once substitute (search and replace) any &quot;<FONT color="purple">call 00401C20</FONT>&quot; 

(which is not a very useful tag for our dead listing perusing) with a much 

more meaningful tag: &quot;<FONT color="purple">call 

00401C20=savefile</FONT>&quot;.<BR>

Note how our substitution did NOT eliminate the location number, you better 

keep always such number locations together with your new tags, because during your cracking sessions you will necessarily 

commit quite 

a lot of mistakes, that you'll correct later. Keeping the original location 

numbers together with your new assigned 'provisory' names will help you a lot 

when needed.<BR> 

Inside 

filemon's dead listing we will find only two occurrences of a call to our &quot;FileSaving&quot; routine but working

on your own targets, later, you'll soon discover how abstruse (and puzzling) 

code 

snippets will suddenly be comprehensible thank to these - very simple -

substitutions<BR>Let's have a look at the relevant filemon's code:<BR>

This snippet of code calls twice the SaveFile function of our target... 

by the way, since this kind of routines are typically called from the main menu 

of the main window (&quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Saveas&quot; inside the &quot;File&quot; main menu option), this snippet will be very probably inside 

a WM_COMMAND structure... more about this later)... here is the part of code calling 

SaveFile:<PRE>:

:00401569 6A00                    push 00000000             ;BOOLEAN FALSE

:0040156B A1B8964000              mov eax, [004096B8]       ;get second par

:00401570 8BB42458010000          mov esi, [esp + 00000158] ;get HWND hWnd

:00401577 50                      push eax                  ;push second par

:00401578 56                      push esi                  ;push HWND hWnd

:00401579 E8A2060000              call 00401C20=savefile

:0040157E 83C40C                  add esp, 0000000C

:00401581 E97E010000              jmp 00401704

:00401586 6A01                    push 00000001             ;BOOLEAN TRUE

:00401588 A1B8964000              mov eax, [004096B8]       ;get second par

:0040158D 8BB42458010000          mov esi, [esp + 00000158] ;get HWND hWnd

:00401594 50                      push eax                  ;push second par

:00401595 56                      push esi                  ;push HWND hWnd

:00401596 E885060000              call 00401C20=savefile

:0040159B 83C40C                  add esp, 0000000C

:0040159E E961010000              jmp 00401704</PRE>

You notice that I have already transformed &quot;call 00401C20&quot; in &quot;call 00401C20=savefile&quot;.  

You may use the same &quot;search and replace&quot; technique also for memory 

locations you have understood the significance of. Usually you'll be lucky every

time that a KNOWN return value of a KNOWN windows function will be stored 

in a specific memory location. This will allow you to prepare easily an immediate 

&quot;search and replace&quot; of the same location in the whole dead listing, whereby you'll 

substitute awkward number-locations with your tags, explaining 

their exact meaning<BR>Yet you'll be able to clear the meaning of quite a lot of 

code even 

if you DO NOT KNOW the exact meaning of a value stored inside a memory 

location... the important thing is that you know <B>where that value is 

used</B>... let's make an example, look at the code above once more.<BR>

This small code snippet let us understand 

that the &quot;homemade&quot; function SaveFile 

of our target accepts THREE parameters (note the three pushes before each 

call).

<BR>One of the three parameters is, clearly, a boolean parameter, either 0 or 1... 

can you guess what this could be... in a &quot;save 

file&quot; operation? It's the <B>&quot;saveas&quot;</B> parameter in alternative to &quot;save&quot;, 

a typical boolean 

parameter for saving operations... we don't even need the confirmation 

of the c code...<BR>Nice... and the other two parameters? The first one (in the C 

call, the last one in assembly) is HWND hWnd, of course, and the other 

one, the &quot;middle&quot; one? We know, from the C source, that's HWND ListBox, 

but we could ALREADY 

have searched and replaced all memory locations &quot;<B>[004096B8]</B>&quot; - 

in the whole dead 

listing - with something like &quot;<B>[004096B8]=SaveFileSecondPar</B>&quot;, and believe 

me, this would have made quite a BIG difference in a huge 7-8 megabytes 

dead listing where you don't even understand what the hell the programmer 

was trying to do, nor where have been hidden, inside the huge codewoods, the 

snippets of the target's code you are looking for.<BR><BR>

OK, we have finished our quick examination of the small snippet above... would 

you like to 

know what it was exactly? It correspond to the following 6 lines of &quot;c&quot; code, 

placed  inside the main &quot;switch&quot; tree (for WM_COMMAND) of the  MainWndProc:<BR>

<PRE>case IDM_SAVE:

  SaveFile( hWnd, hWndList, FALSE );

  return 0;



case IDM_SAVEAS:

  SaveFile( hWnd, hWndList, TRUE );

  return 0;</PRE>

<BR>

<FONT size="+2"><B>Let's start cracking: the first function</B></FONT><BR>

Now let's start together anew, take your sheets with the C source code have 

a general look, prepare your favourite cocktail (may I suggest a 

<A href="cocktail.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/cocktail.htm">traitor</A>?) and then jump with me inside the disassembled 

target...<BR>

If you just read the disassembled code that follows, with my comments, you'll 

notice pretty easily how the c source code has been &quot;translated&quot; in assembler.<BR>

The first windows' function in the C source code is ABORT, let's examine first of all its &quot;C&quot; code:<BR>

<PRE>/********************************************************************

*	FUNCTION:	Abort:

*	PURPOSE:	Handles emergency exit conditions.

*********************************************************************/

void Abort( HWND hWnd, TCHAR * Msg )

{	MessageBox( hWnd, Msg, &quot;filemon&quot;, MB_OK );

	PostQuitMessage( 1 );

}</PRE>	

Note the 4 parameters of the Messagebox function: from left to right:

hWnd, Msg, &quot;progname&quot;, MB_OK... as you'll now see, in assembly they will be pushed in 

REVERSE ORDER: MB_OK, &quot;progname&quot;, Msg, hWnd,<BR>

And here is the code of our target<BR>

<PRE>

//********************** Start of Code in Object .text **************

Program Entry Point = 004024E0 (Filemon.exe File Offset:000018E0)

:00401000 8B442408       mov eax, [esp + 08]       ;get msg in eax

:00401004 6A00           push 0                    ;push right parameter: MB_OK (=0)

:00401006 8B4C2408       mov ecx, [esp + 08]       ;get hWnd in ecx

:0040100A 68C0804000     push 004080C0             ;push StringData &quot;filemon&quot;

:0040100F 50             push eax                  ;push msg

:00401010 51             push ecx	              ;push hWnd

:00401011 FF1590B24400   Call dword ptr [0044B290] ;call USER32.MessageBoxA 

:00401017 6A01           push 1                    ;push 1 for PostQuit

:00401019 FF1588B24400   Call dword ptr [0044B288] ;call USER32.PostQuitMessage 

:0040101F C3             ret			      ;finis

</PRE>

What does this little introductory example mean from a reverse engineering point 

of view?

It means, for a start, that EVERY TIME you find a &quot;call USER32.MessageBoxA&quot; 

function, in 

your disassembled listing you may substitute IMMEDIATELY the 4 pushes preceding 

it 

with:<BR>

First push: whatever MessageBoxStyle has been called (Here 0 = MB_0K)... see below 

the complete list<BR> 

Second push: Title of the MsgBox<BR> 

Third push: Msg<BR>

Fourth push: hWnd<BR>

<BR>

You dig it?<BR>It's the same old story we already (should) know from dos reverse 

engineering actually:<BR>

All it happens when passing parameters to a C++ function is that you push the 

rightmost parameter first, then the next rightmost parameter, and so on, until 

the leftmost parameter has been pushed. Then the function is called... say you 

call the C library function strcpy to copy <I>SourceString</I> to 

<I>DestString</I>... in c++ you would type:<PRE>

strcpy (DestString, SourceString);</PRE>

The same call in assembler works like this<BR><PRE>

lea ax,SourceString	;rightmost parameter

lea bx,DestString	;leftmost parameter

push ax			;push rightmost first

push bx			;push next one

call _strcpy		;copy the string using pre-made code

add sp,4		;DISCARD used parameters</PRE>

Everything depends from the <FONT color="red">CALLING CONVENTION!</FONT><BR>

The <FONT color="blue"><B>C calling convention</B></FONT> pushes rightmost first 

and discards parameters from stack;<BR>

The <FONT color="blue"><B>Pascal calling convention</B></FONT> pushes leftmost 

first and the <I>called</I> program 

discards the parameter from the stack.<BR><BR>

It's therefore quite important to understand first of all wich convention uses your 

target, which is pretty easy, since you just need to have a look to a known windows 

function.<BR><BR>

<FONT size="+2"><B>The old good MessageBox function</B></FONT><BR>

But we are not yet finished with our messagebox function,, I'll use this very 

function in order to explain you &quot;in the deep&quot; a single Windows' function, it's 

up to you, obviously, to learn as much as you can about the more important 

windows' functions... 

I know, I know, it's an awful operating system, yet we MUST STUDY IT, unfortunately, 

in order to reverse it whenever we feel like it. In the following example, regarding 

MessageBox, you'll find a description <U>useful for reverse engineering purposes</U>, 

the descriptions you'll find inside the WinAPI references of the main languages 

compilers are similar, but <U>they are aimed at programmers that usually DO NOT 

need to know how to disassemble their program effectively</U> and therefore are 

not always useful, nor complete. In fact the basical  

syntax for messagebox is the following:<BR><PRE><FONT color="purple">

<CENTER><FONT size="+2">  int MessageBox(hwndParent, lpszText, lpszTitle, fuStyle)

</FONT></CENTER>



HWND hwndParent;        /* handle of parent window           */

LPCSTR lpszText;        /* address of text in message box    */

LPCSTR lpszTitle;       /* address of title of message box   */

UINT fuStyle;           /* style of message box              */





The MessageBox function creates, displays, and operates a message-box window. 

The message box contains an application-defined message and title, plus any

combination of the predefined icons and push buttons described in the fuStyle

parameter. 



Parameter	Description



hwndParent     Identifies the parent window of the message box to be created. 

               If this parameter is NULL, the message box will have no parent 

               window. 

LpszText       Points to a null-terminated string containing the message to 

               be displayed. 

LpszTitle      Points to a null-terminated string to be used for the dialog 

               box title. If this parameter is NULL, the default title Error 

               is used. 

fuStyle	       Specifies the contents and behavior of the dialog box. 

               This parameter can be a combination of the following values: 

Value	Meaning



MB_ABORTRETRYIGNORE	The message box contains three push buttons: 

                       Abort, Retry, and Ignore. 

<U>This value is 0x00000002L</U>



MB_APPLMODAL	        The user must respond to the message box before 

                       continuing work in the window identified by the 

                       hwndParent parameter. However, the user can move 

                       to the windows of other applications and work in 

                       those windows. MB_APPLMODAL is the default if 

                       neither MB_SYSTEMMODAL nor MB_TASKMODAL is 

                       specified. 

<U>This value is 0x00000000L</U>



MB_DEFBUTTON1	        The first button is the default. Note that the 

                       first button is always the default unless MB_DEFBUTTON2 

                       or MB_DEFBUTTON3 is specified. 

<U>This value is 0x00000000L</U>



MB_DEFBUTTON2	        The second button is the default. 

<U>This value is 0x00000100L</U>



MB_DEFBUTTON3	        The third button is the default. 

<U>This value is 0x00000200L</U>



MB_ICONASTERISK	 Same as MB_ICONINFORMATION. 

<U>This value is 0x00000040L</U>



MB_ICONEXCLAMATION	 An exclamation-point icon appears in the message box. 

<U>This value is 0x00000030L</U>



MB_ICONHAND	         Same as MB_ICONSTOP. 

<U>This value is 0x00000010L</U>



MB_ICONINFORMATION	 An icon consisting of a lowercase letter &quot;I&quot; in a 

                        circle appears in the message box. 

<U>This value is 0x00000040L</U>



MB_ICONQUESTION         A question-mark icon appears in the message box. 

<U>This value is 0x00000020L</U>



MB_ICONSTOP             A stop-sign icon appears in the message box.

<U>This value is 0x00000010L</U> 



MB_OK	                The message box contains one push button: OK. 

<U>This value is 0x00000000L</U>



MB_OKCANCEL	         The message box contains two push buttons: OK and Cancel. 

<U>This value is 0x00000001L</U>



MB_RETRYCANCEL	         The message box contains two push buttons: Retry and Cancel. 

<U>This value is 0x00000005L</U>



MB_SYSTEMMODAL	         All applications are suspended until the user responds to 

                        the message box. Unless the application specifies MB_ICONHAND,

                        the message box does not become modal until after it is

                        created; consequently, the parent window and other windows

                        continue to receive messages resulting from its activation. 

                        System-modal message boxes are used to notify the user of

                        serious, potentially damaging errors that require immediate

                        attention (for example, running out of memory). 

<U>This value is 0x00001000L</U>



MB_TASKMODAL	         Same as MB_APPLMODAL except that all the top-level windows 

                        belonging to the current task are disabled if the hwndParent

                        parameter is NULL. This flag should be used when the calling 

                        application or library does not have a window handle available         

                        but still needs to prevent input to other windows in the 

                        current application without suspending other applications.

<U>This value is 0x00002000L</U>



MB_YESNO	         The message box contains two push buttons: Yes and No. 

<U>This value is 0x00000004L</U>

MB_YESNOCANCEL	         The message box contains three push buttons: Yes, No, and             

                        Cancel. 

<U>This value is 0x00000003L</U>

</FONT></PRE>

As you can see, the possible values are 0,1,2,3,4,5,10,20,30,40,100,200,100, 2000<BR>

(there are also other values, more rare: F, FO, F00, 3000, 8000, C000, 20000... you'll 

find them out either experimenting a little or reverse engineering a lot :-)

<PRE><FONT color="blue"><B>Returns</B></FONT><FONT color="purple">

The return value is zero if there is not enough memory to create the message box. 

Otherwise, it is one of the following menu-item values returned by the dialog box:



Value	    Real value     Meaning



ERROR         (0)	    fcked 

IDOK          (1)           OK button was selected. 

IDCANCEL      (2)           Cancel button was selected.

IDABORT	      (3)           Abort button was selected. 

IDRETRY	      (4)           Retry button was selected.

IDIGNORE      (5)           Ignore button was selected. 

IDYES         (6)           Yes button was selected. 

IDNO          (7)           No button was selected.



If a message box has a Cancel button, the IDCANCEL value will be returned 

if either the ESC key is pressed or the Cancel button is selected. If the 

message box has no Cancel button, pressing ESC has no effect.



Comments

When a system-modal message box is created to indicate that the system is 

low on memory, the strings pointed to by the lpszText and lpszTitle 

parameters should not be taken from a resource file, because an attempt 

to load the resource may fail. 



When an application calls the MessageBox function and specifies the 

MB_ICONHAND and MB_SYSTEMMODAL flags for the fuStyle parameter, Windows 

displays the resulting message box regardless of available memory. 

When these flags are specified, Windows limits the length of the 

message-box text to three lines. Windows does not automatically break 

the lines to fit in the message box, however, so the message string 

must contain carriage returns to break the lines at the appropriate 

places. 

If a message box is created while a dialog box is present, use the 

handle of the dialog box as the hwndParent parameter. The hwndParent 

parameter should not identify a child window, such as a control in 

a dialog box.

<BR><BR>OK, we have seen &quot;in the deep&quot; a single Windows' function, you would be well 

advised to prepare yourself some &quot;information sheets&quot;, like the above one, for your 

own use, about the most important and more frequent windows functions, <U>WITH the 

values of the constants</U> that windows uses... you'll see how easy it is to 

understand what an unknown part of a program is doing just examining how it handles 

the DIFFERENT possible return values...<BR>This is obviously not the case here... 

remember what we are doing, we are just examining an &quot;ABORT&quot; error function, an 

anormal function that will show the user only a short error message and offer him 

the OK button to click onto... you could modify the code at<BR><PRE>:00401004 6A00      push 0        ;push right parameter: MB_OK (=0)</PRE>

into:<PRE>:00401004 6A01      push 1        ;push right parameter: MB_OKCANCEL (=1)</PRE>

Yet modifying this code would not make much sense: you would see two push buttons: OK and Cancel, <U>only in the event of an error</U> (a 

pretty futile reverse engineering exercise :-)<BR>

<FONT size="+2"><B>The InitApplication function of filemon</B></FONT><BR>

Now that we have seen the ABORT function of filemon, let's work on the next 

routines  of our target... be patient and follow me: if you read carefully 

this short essay you'll master the rudiments of windows reverse engineering.<BR><BR>

The following function, inside our C source code, is WinMain... since WinMAin is a KNOWN function (which usually calls InitInstance and InitApp before entering a ghetmaessage loop), WinMain will be one of the LAST code snippets that 

we'll reverse, we'll see first a lot of other, more or less &quot;home-made&quot; procedures that  we'll &quot;solve&quot; first (once more: we have the c 

source code of this target, yet my aim is to teach you how to reverse engineer targets you 

DO NOT have the source code of, we'll soon operate AS IF we did not have any source code at all, bear with me :-)<BR>

We'll pass to the next procedure, the one after Winmain. This is a standard InitApp procedure (as you'll see in the FOURTH) part of this lesson) here is its C source code:

Which is a part of WinMain, btw.<BR><BR>

<FONT size="+2"><B>The trick for finding MainWndProc</B></FONT><BR>

God, I realize now that I should begin to explain the whole WNDCLASS structure... 

please 

study it yourself... if you bought (as you should have done) the COMPLETE Borland 

C++ Version 

4.52 for less than 4 UK pounds (see <A href="blackbo.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/blackbo.htm">here</A>), you'll have 

all 

important specs at your fingertips from the huge API helpfiles (7 million bytes 

for Win32 and 3 million 

bytes for Win31).<BR>I'll explain here only part of the API calls... The most 

important element here, for us, is that WNDCLASS' member lpfnWndProc 

<FONT color="blue">POINTS TO THE CALLBACK WINDOW PROCEDURE!</FONT><BR> 

Let's approach the above code (of InitApplication) slowly... What was the value &quot;401190&quot; at 10C4?<PRE>

:004010C4 C744240890114000        mov [esp + 08], 00401190</PRE>

That is the location of the MainWndProc!<BR>Windows is so kind to tell us, in 

many 

occasions, WHERE the &quot;obligatory&quot; functions of an unknown program start!<BR>If 

Peter 

Urbanik, the author of Wdasm, would listen to us, instead of uselessly updating 

his program every 

couple of weeks, he would work on this to get a spectacular tool for reverse 

engineering!<BR>OK, every single WNDCLASS call of a windows program carries 

inside itself

the location of the caller... in this case (as in most initialization parts of code) 

WNDCLASS is called at initialization by a little initialization routine (here in 

filemon called InitInstance) which is in turn called by the main &quot;homemade&quot; 

procedure of our target, here in filemon called MainWndProc... nice to know, 

isn't it?<BR>There is more: since WNDCLASS has a parameter lpszClassName, which 

points to a null-terminated string that specifies the name of the window class  

(in the case of filemon 

&quot;filemonClass&quot;), it's pretty easy to find all occurrences of WNDCLASS inside any  

unknown target just examining its strings (and you can use good old Frattaroli's <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/strings.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/strings.zip'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/strings.zip">strings.zip</A>to do it) ... nice isn't it?<BR>

<BR>What have we more up there? Let's see<PRE>

:004010EC 68007F0000          push 00007F00 ;IDC_ARROW</PRE>

hCursor	Identifies the class cursor. This member must be a handle to a cursor 

resource. There are many resources of each type, for the joy of a good reverse 

engineer...<BR>

Here you go! experiment a little (change it with Hexworkshop inside filemon.exe, play 

with your targets! In this specific case you wont see much, though, because this 

is the &quot;ghost&quot; &quot;loaded&quot; cursor of filemon... you should change the SetCursor 

function's parameter to change the cursor of an application)<PRE>

32512 (0x7F00) = IDC_ARROW	;that's what we have

32513 (0x7F01) = IDC_IBEAM	;Text I-beam cursor.

32514 (0x7F02) = IDC_WAIT	;that's the hourglass

...

32560		= IDC_APPSTARTING</PRE>

Another parameter:<PRE>

:004010FD 6A01                push 00000001 ;LTGRAY_BRUSH</PRE>

Since GRAY BRUSH is 2 and DARKGRAY BRUSH is 3, you may experiment as well with 

some colors... If you substitute :004010FD 6A01 with :004010FD 6A03 you'll indeed 

see (for a moment) your DKGRAY_BRUSH &quot;behind&quot; the filling of the main window of 

filemon, once more this is the &quot;initializing&quot; routine, which is called at the 

beginning of our target's life, many parameter will be &quot;reconfirmed&quot; later on.<BR>

What's more up there? Yes: RegisterWindowClass... once created, the WNDCLASS data 

must be &quot;registered&quot; in order to pass to the subsequent CreateWindow function...

Let's have a look at the code of WinMain that will be performed if the InitApplication 

routine returns successful...<PRE>

Ok, let's have a look at this important function:<BR><PRE><FONT color="purple">

HWND CreateWindow(lpszClassName, lpszWindowName, dwStyle, x, y, nWidth, nHeight, 

hwndParent, hmenu, hinst, lpvParam)



LPCSTR lpszClassName;       /* address of registered class name        */

LPCSTR lpszWindowName;      /* address of window text                  */

DWORD dwStyle;              /* window style                            */

int x;                      /* horizontal position of window           */

int y;                      /* vertical position of window             */

int nWidth;                 /* window width                            */

int nHeight;                /* window height                           */

HWND hwndParent;            /* handle of parent window                 */

HMENU hmenu;                /* handle of menu or child-window identifier */

HINSTANCE hinst;            /* handle of application instance          */

void FAR* lpvParam;         /* address of window-creation data         */

</FONT><BR>

lpszClassName      is &quot;filemonClass&quot; (what we have registered)

lpszWindowName     is &quot;Win95 File Monitor&quot; (what you see in the main window of

                   filemon)

dwStyle            is WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW = 00CF0000 (which creates an overlapped

                   window having the WS_OVERLAPPED, WS_CAPTION, WS_SYSMENU,

                   WS_THICKFRAME, WS_MINIMIZEBOX, and WS_MAXIMIZEBOX styles)

int x              is CW_USEDEFAULT</PRE>

This value specifies the initial x-position of the window. For an overlapped or pop-up 

window, the x parameter is the initial x-coordinate of the window's upper-left corner, 

in screen coordinates. For a child window, x is the x-coordinate of the upper-left 

corner of the window in the client area of its parent window. If, like here in filemon, 

this value is CW_USEDEFAULT, Windows selects the default position for the window's 

upper-left corner and ignores the y parameter. CW_USEDEFAULT is valid only for 

overlapped windows... if you firmly believe that Mark Russinovich and Bryce 

Cogswell should have let their program appear in the top left corner of the 

screen instead of using the default position then go ahead! Modify whatever 

you want!<PRE>Int y               is CW_USEDEFAULT, as above for the y-position	

nWidth              is CW_USEDEFAULT</PRE> 

This value specifies the width, in device units, of the window. For overlapped windows, 

the nWidth parameter is either the window's width (in screen coordinates) or 

CW_USEDEFAULT. If nWidth is CW_USEDEFAULT, like here in filemon, Windows selects 

a default width and height for the window (the default width extends from the 

initial x-position to the right edge of the screen, and the default height extends 

from the initial y-position to the top of the icon area). CW_USEDEFAULT is valid only 

for overlapped windows.<PRE>nHeight	             is CW_USEDEFAULT, as above for the 

height

hwndParent	      is NULL. This value identifies the parent or owner window of the

                     window being created. Overlapped windows must NOT have a parent

                     (hParent must be NULL)

hMenu                is NULL, handle of menu identifier

hInstance            is the value in eax, and identifies the instance of the module to

                      be associated with the window.

LpvParam             is the WM_CREATE param

</PRE>



Well, what returns CreateWindow? The return value is the handle of the new window if 

the function is successful. Otherwise, it is NULL. Everything is OK with old good 

filemon, let's continue...<BR><BR>



A window has been &quot;made&quot; it's name is hWndMain let's show it to the world<PRE>

:ShowWindow(hWndMain, nCmdShow); make the window visible &amp; update its client area

:00401176 8B44240C        mov eax, [esp + 0C] ;get nCmdShow

:0040117A 50              push eax            ; nCmdShow

:0040117B 56              push esi            ; hWndMain (handle was in esi)

:0040117C FF15ECB24400    Call dword ptr [0044B2EC] ;USER32.ShowWindow, Ord:022Ch

 

UpdateWindow(hWndMain);

:00401182 56              push esi ; hWndMain (handle was in esi)

:00401183 FF15F0B24400    Call dword ptr [0044B2F0] ;USER32.UpdateWindow, Ord:024Fh 

:00401189 8BC6            mov eax, esi ;return to WinMain with hWndMain in eax

:0040118B 5E              pop esi ;let's have the old esi back

:0040118C C3              ret</PRE>



If you never programmed before, you could legitimately ask yourself why the hell we 

have to show and update a window we have created a minute ago... see: ShowWindow 

specifies <U><B>how</B></U> the window is to be shown... hide=0, normal=1, otherzoom=2, 

maximize=3, otherunzoom=4, show=5 etc... therefore the value in esp+0C determines HOW 

the windows will appear, and it has been already determined calling  WinMain, which 

has following parameters: int APIENTRY WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE 

hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow), the last  &quot;int&quot; one being the 

nCmdShow... have a look in the code following the program entry point for this.<BR>

Once show, the window must be updated. The UpdateWindow function updates the client 

area of our window by sending a WM_PAINT message to the window if the update region 

for the window is not empty. The function sends a WM_PAINT message directly to the 

window procedure, bypassing the application queue. If the update region is empty, 

no message is sent.



<BR>

We are now finished with the InitInstance procedure, have our nice main window, 

must move on: back to WinMain!
