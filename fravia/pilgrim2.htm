Further FlexCrypt analysis

==========================





pilgrim 7th January 1999



Introduction

============



Globetrotters FlexLm has been discussed by Siul+Hacky and myself

previously.

One of the first stages in analysing FlexLm is to crack the encryption

used to package it:

FlexCrypt.

FlexCrypt is produced by Globetrotter Software Inc 

and seems to share may commonalities with FlexLm.

This document analyses the FlexCrypt en/de-cryption program to a stage 

that allows decryption of any FlexCrypted package.

This in turn leads into some interesting areas worthy of further

investigation.



Tools required

==============



IDA ( 3.75 used in example )

W32DASM ( V8.9 used in the example )

Install-shield decompiler ( isdcc V1.1 used in example )

HexEditor ( Hiew V5.66 used in example )

Recommended files

=================



For a full explanation you'll need to download two files: flexlm5.12

and flexlm6.1



<A href="javascript:if(confirm('ftp://ftp.globes.com/flexlm/v5.12/windows/flexmin.exe  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='ftp://ftp.globes.com/flexlm/v5.12/windows/flexmin.exe'" tppabs="ftp://ftp.globes.com/flexlm/v5.12/windows/flexmin.exe" target=_blank>ftp://ftp.globes.com/flexlm/v5.12/windows/flexmin.exe</A> ( 4,088,198

The site also contains many other flexcrypted files to practise on.



FlexCrypt basics

================



FlexCrypt uses a rolling XOR based scheme to encrypt a file.

It uses the same key on 8 bytes, recalculates the key, then continues

through the file.

The key is in some way based on the passkey you must find for correct

decryption.

The passkey is of the format xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-nn

where the x are hexadecimal numbers and nn ranges from 00 to 99 decimal.

The hex numbers are in some way related to your PC ( hard disc number

/ network card number ).

The nn specifies which of 100 keys was used to encrypt the file. 

Only one nn value decrypts the file correctly.

There is a table which stores 100 passkey related values in the

decryption executable.

There are many versions of FlexCrypt available, but there is basically

a 16bit and 32bit.

Both use the same encryption method.

32 bit introduces a file header with some sort of file/passkey check

data included.

All FlexCrypt files may easily be decrypted correctly using the 32 bit

decryption program.

The decryption program is packaged with the install files and is

usually called something 

like cryptwin.exe

Command line options for decrypt.exe:

-p xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-nn : the passkey

-t Z *.fc : decrypt all .fc extension files to files with .Z extension

-d n : debug mode, n can take values 1,2,3 each displaying differing

formats of debug info



Stage 1 :  how to decrypt the files

===================================



Run the install.exe from the downloaded FlexLm 5.12.

This will extract all the files needed for the install.

Run setup.exe

You'll be asked for the FlexLm decryption key in the format

xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx

Cancel the install.

We see a setup.ins file : installshield is here

Use isdcc to decompile the install script.

Have a look for the text we saw earlier, xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx, and

we see:



AskText("Please enter in your decryption key.  It should be of the

form xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx .  If you do not have this key, you can

obtain it by calling Globetrotter Software at (408) 370-2800  If you

do not have a key at this time, please press cancel to end t",

"xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx", string15);

Sprintf(lString1, "%scryptwin.exe", SRCDIR);

Sprintf(lString2, "Decrypting files, this may take some time");

function11(lString2, 1);

Sprintf(lString0, "-w %s  -p %s -t Z *.fc", SRCDIR, string15);



This decodes to:



cryptwin.exe -p xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx -t Z *.fc



where xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xx would be the numbers you type.

-p option is password

-t is convert *.FC into *.Z type



So rename cryptw~1.exe to it's full title, cryptwin.exe, and try 

cryptwin.exe -p 0000-0000-0000-0000-00 -t Z *.fc 

We end up with zero length Z files. Not too good.



Cryptwin is 16-bit, so let's use IDA to dissassemble it.

At this moment I'm interested in command line options so let's have a

look.

Searching for -p gives us a function at loc_8B6_6C which looks like a

command line parser.

It seems to also accept -x -o -i -e and -d options

What's -d? debug? There's references to DEBUG in the exe, let's try it.

A bit of experimenting shows there are 3 debug levels, with varying

outputs,

1 writes a log file, 2 displays on the screen, 3 uses pop-up windows.



Stage 2 : Get a valid passkey

=============================



32 bit's easier to debug than 16 bit so let's abandon FlexLm 5.12 for

now and try FlexLm 6.1



Clear the Windows\Temp directory and run the FlexLm 6.1 install.

When prompted for the key press cancel and copy all the files into

another work directory.



Let's try cryptwin.exe -d 3 -p 0000-0000-0000-0000-00 -t Z *.fc again.

Again we end up with a zero length Z file.

Dissasemble cryptwin.exe using W32DASM.

Load the program with the command line options -p

0000-0000-0000-0000-00 -t Z *.fc

Put a break-point on the reference to "%.4d-%.4d-%.4d-%.4d"

Run to the break point then single step.



* Possible StringData Ref from Data Obj -&gt;"%.4d-%.4d-%.4d-%.4d"

:00405E2F 6870B04200              push 0042B070

:00405E34 BE60F34200              mov esi, 0042F360

:00405E39 56                      push esi

:00405E3A E8A1840100              call 0041E2E0

:00405E3F 83C418                  add esp, 00000018



In this case there's a call to 0041E2E0 which returns esi pointing to

the processed string,

which looks something like:



[esi+00000000] - 7375

[esi+00000004] - -553

[esi+00000008] - 2-55

[esi+0000000C] - 21-5

[esi+00000010] - 871.



This string appears to be related to machine specific items such as

hard disk number

and network card number. This string is the first four numbers of a

potentially valid

passkey. The last two digits are the key number used in the test. In

this case 00.



OK, we have a key to try, it's 7375-5532-5521-5871-00

So let's try cryptwin.exe -d 3 -p 7375-5532-5521-5871-00 -t Z *.fc 

Again, an error message and a zero file.



We need to repeat the above process using keys 00 to 99 as the last

two digits in the password.

This would be a very slow process using DASM.

So modify the cryptwin program to generate a file with a name of each

passkey.



Stage 2a: auto generate the passkeys

====================================



Copy your original cryptwin.exe to something else, I used dcrypt.exe.

Using your favourite hexeditor, modify dcrypt.exe as follows:



1) Just after esi points to the passkey string, jump to some unused

code space:



Replace

:00405E3F 83C418                  add esp, 00000018

:00405E42 57                      push edi

:00405E43 E80C000000              call 00405E54

With

:00405E3F 83C418                  add esp, 00000018

:00405E42 E9E1B9FFFF              jmp 00401828



2) At this unused space, 00401828, replace the existing code with:



:00401828 6A00                    push 00000000

:0040182A 6880000000              push 00000080

:0040182F 6A01                    push 00000001

:00401831 6A00                    push 00000000

:00401833 6A03                    push 00000003

:00401835 68000000C0              push C0000000

:0040183A 8BC6                    mov eax, esi

:0040183C 50                      push eax

* Reference To: KERNEL32.CreateFileA, Ord:0030h

:0040183D E8CC760200              Call 00428F0E    &lt;- create the file

:00401842 50                      push eax

* Reference To: KERNEL32.CloseHandle, Ord:0017h

:00401843 FF15BC324300            Call dword ptr [004332BC] &lt;- close

the file handle

* Reference To: KERNEL32.ExitProcess, Ord:006Ah

:00401849 FF158C324300            Call dword ptr [0043328C] &lt;- end the

program



Now run the dcrypt.exe with the command line options -p

0000-0000-0000-0000-00 -t Z *.fc

You should get a file of name 7375-5532-5521-5871



Now write 2 batch files to run through 00 to 99 and store the results:



test2.bat:

call test.bat 00

call test.bat 01 .... to .....

call test.bat 98

call test.bat 99



test.bat:

dcrypt -p 0000-0000-0000-0000-%1 -t cab data1.fc

rename ????-????-????-???? ????-????-????-????-%1



This gives 100 files with potential passkeys to try.

Note that these passkeys will differ on different machines.



So now we want to try each one and see when we get a valid result.

Dir all the files into a text file and run a macro to get something like

cryptwin -p 7375-5532-5521-5871-00 -t cab data1.fc

pause 

... etc for each key



I checked the size of the decrypted file after each try.

It's non-zero when it's been decrypted correctly.

( further work: you may be able to use the debug error level to tell

you when it's worked )



You'll eventually end up with the correct key for your machine.

Once you've got it you can then use it to decrypt all the fc files.



Stage 3: Repackage so you don't need the key again.

===================================================



It would be wise to repackage the FlexLm 6.1 so you don't need the key

again.

Delete the cryptwin.exe and the *.Z files then try installing again.

You can now enter any passkey and FlexLm6.1 will install.



Stage 4: Try decrypting another package.

========================================



Let's try the passkey we got above with the 16 bit FlexLm5.12

No good. 

That's because the 16bit cryptwin.exe has a different set of keys

stored in it's executable.

OK, so let's try decrypting the 16bit FC files using the 32bit cryptwin.

This may work as we know the key for the 32bit decrypter.

Well, we get some Z files, no error messages, but the files are corrupt.

Open up a Z file with your favourite hex editor and have a look.

Mmmm, lots of repeating 8 byte patterns. 

Looks like we've decrypted the file but with the wrong start value.



Stage 4a: A diversion ... partial analysis of file decryption

=============================================================



Time to look at how crypwin.exe decrypts the fc file.

Open up the disassembled cryptwin.exe from FlexLm6.1, and look at

00402d1d:

( Some dissassembly has been removed )



1) Read the file and see if it contains the "FLEXcrypt Copyright"

signature

   If it does then this is a new 32bit generated file, else it's a

16bit file



:00402D1D 55                      push ebp

....

:00402D58 51                      push ecx

:00402D59 E8D2A60100              call 0041D430 &lt;- fread "FlexCryp"

from the file

...

                                        -&gt;"Globetrotter Software, Inc."

:00402D66 6870AE4200              push 0042AE70

:00402D6B 51                      push ecx

:00402D6C E8CFC40100              call 0041F240 &lt;- Compare the 2 strings

:00402D71 83C40C                  add esp, 0000000C

:00402D74 85C0                    test eax, eax

:00402D76 7579                    jne 00402DF1 &lt;- Jump if it's 16bit

straight to decrypt file



2) This is a 32bit file with a valid header

   The analysis of this next section needs some more work, it may hold

more clues.

   The code reads some sort of checksum from the file header

   The first 8 bytes of data are decrypted

   The data is then compared with something and a pass/fail is

determined.



:00402D78 FF7508                  push [ebp+08]

Stage 5: XOR the incorrectly decrypted file

===========================================



As mentioned above, it's as if we've used the wrong start point to

decrypt the FC file.

And from the analysis above we can see it's an XOR decryption.

So how about finding some likely looking zeros in the file.

XOR of zero with a key is zero.

If we XOR the file with the value stored at a zero we may get a

working file.

Open up the html.Z that comes with FlexLm5.12 with your hex editor.

I spy lots of repeats at 40hex, in my case, d361f5a2006ebb12.

Let's try XORing the whole file with d361f5a2006ebb12.



I wrote a little C program to do this, ( main parts only shown ):



void main()

{

FILE *ReadFile, *WriteFile;

unsigned char xor_table[8]={0xd3,0x61,0xf5,0xa2,0x00,0x6e,0xbb,0x12};

ReadFile=fopen("test.x","rb");     /* Open up the project file to read

*/

WriteFile=fopen("test.z","wb+");   /* Open up the new project file to

write */

init=0;

i=0;

while (feof(ReadFile) == 0) /* Repeat until the end of the read file

is reached */

{  

  c=fgetc(ReadFile);

  if (init==1)

    c^=xor_table[i];

  i++;

  i&=7;

  init =1;

  fputc(c,WriteFile);

}

fclose(ReadFile);

fclose(WriteFile);

}



Run this on the files and they look like they should work, but they're

still corrupt.



Stage 6: correct the first 8 bytes of the file

==============================================



The problem is the first 8 bytes of the data are not correct.

Further work: I think the first 8 bytes have something to do with the

initial decrypt value.

This doesn't pose a problem as FlexCrypt is typically used to encrypt

files with known headers.

For an installshield Z file the first 8 bytes are

13,5D,65,8C,3A,01,02,00

For an installshield CAB file the first 8 bytes are

49,53,63,28,04,00,00,01

So I modified my XOR code to skip the first 8 bytes and replace them

with the correct header:



void main()

{

FILE *ReadFile, *WriteFile;

unsigned char xor_table[8]={0xd3,0x61,0xf5,0xa2,0x00,0x6e,0xbb,0x12};

unsigned char z_header[8] ={0x13,0x5D,0x65,0x8C,0x3A,0x01,0x02,0x00};

ReadFile=fopen("test.x","rb");     /* Open up the project file to read

*/

WriteFile=fopen("test.z","wb+");   /* Open up the new project file to

write */

/* Skip the first 8 bytes and write the Z file header */

for (i=0;i&lt;8;i++)

{

  c=fgetc(ReadFile);

  fputc(z_header[i],WriteFile);

}

init=0;

i=0;

while (feof(ReadFile) == 0) /* Repeat until the end of the read file

is reached */

{  

  c=fgetc(ReadFile);

  if (init==1)

    c^=xor_table[i];

  i++;

  i&=7;

  init =1;

  fputc(c,WriteFile);

}

fclose(ReadFile);

fclose(WriteFile);

}



Run this and your encrypted files are now decrypted.

As before, remove the cryptwin.exe and the FC files and your

installation will now accept 

any passkey.



FlexCrypt further work

======================



Now we can decrypt ANY FlexCrypted file.

This includes the FlexCrypt developers kit.

So download this, decrypt it and we get a useful html manual and some

source code.

Have a look a mycode.c and cryptkit.h

It appears that the kit uses FlexLm license data to encrypt the keys

stored in the code.

There's an array fc_keytab[256] stored in the cryptwin.exe 

which contains the 8 bytes keys to use XORed with vendorkey5.

As we know from FlexLm cracking, vendorkey5 is the hard one to find.

And we also know it's calculated on the fly from the other vendor codes.

So maybe cryptwin.exe has the necessary license data stored in it's EXE?



Using your favourite hex editor open up cryptwin.exe from FleLm 6.1

Have a look at offset 002a5c0, I think this is the fc_keytab table.

Looking at the rest of the code it seems to have lots of FlexLm code

embedded in it.

And we've cracked this before.



So maybe, by analysis of the cryptwin.exe and the FC file it may be

possible to determine

which key will work, without all the effort above.



Conclusion

==========



The above document shows how we can decrypt ANY FlexCrypted file.

Further work may show the essence of FlexCrypt and it's relationship

with FlexLm.



Thanks to the people out there who continue to reveal the light.
