hi +fravia, 

it's curious, linux surprises myself. Two or three essays ago i was

convinced they would be the last ones commenting general facts. I was

thinking that new articles would be just explanations of some

interesting

protection scheme, but nothing else. Well, my friend there are lot of

things left :-).<BR>And think that protectors have not started to think, this

is

just a kid playing with the system. 

<BR>

Hope it'll like you,

<BR>

SiuL+Hacky

<BR><BR>

ps. by the way, have you ever think of how incredibly well protected is

the whole fucking machine outthere. The problem is that you need a

good deal of technical background or some kind of Richard Feynman close

to

you :-). It's a good job we have not lost our chance to learn !

<P>I must admit one of the funny ways to crack applications is using

dlls from the

program; it is what we've called <EM>Object Oriented Cracking</EM>. In

my opinion that's

one of the more powerful and witty approaches i've seen. Despite this

fact, i faced in my

last windows-cracking-times, the problem of calling routines that were

not present in

dlls, but executables. </P>



<P>The general problem is: imagine a program that validates some code.

As a matter of

fact, what the interesting routine does is not important, but think

about you have to

modify the execution flow in order to test different things. Sometimes

you can just patch

the code, but many times the amount of foreign code you must enter is

larger that the code

you can fit into &quot;dead areas&quot;. You can always, of course,

overwrite code, but i

always thought that's not a quite elegant approach. One example is a

validation routine

that it's not easy to clone, because some kind of data is initialized,

and you have to

call just in the right moment, neither before nor after. Now i want to

make a brute force

attack and i need to give room for my code that generates new

alternatives, test them, and

show me somehow that i've been successful. </P>

<P>Now we're gonna see different ways to do it. Some of them proved to

be impossible,

others were rather complicated and others were finally good. You'll see

if some of them

could deserve further development, and it would be happy if someone can

do useful things

with options i refused (or even better, new ones). </P>



<H3><U><STRONG>1. MODIFYING ELF HEADERS </STRONG></U></H3>



<P>The first idea was to simply ADD the code. As i briefly explained in

my very first

linux essay, linux uses mainly ELF format executables, whose structure

is really modular,

so one could think about just appending your code to some part of the

executable. There

two documents about ELF format (that i know of), that will answer many

of the question

that can arise: </P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color="#FF0000">elf.hps</FONT> -> Format

gory details <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color="#FF0000">elf.ps.gz</FONT> ->

Programmers guide</P>



<P>Firstly a small review about ELF format. Three elements are

important: 



<UL>

  <LI><STRONG>Elf header</STRONG>: is located at the beginning of the

file, it carries

    information about the size and location of the other two parts </LI>

  <LI><STRONG>Program headers</STRONG>: it's an array where the

different segments that will

    be loaded to memory are defined. Usually the array has 5 members.

Here's an example:

    (vaddrs and paddrs stand for virtual and physical address) </LI>

</UL>



<PRE><SMALL>Program Header:

    PHDR off    0x00000034 vaddr 0x08048034 paddr 0x08048034 align 2**2

         filesz 0x000000a0 memsz 0x000000a0 flags r-x

  INTERP off    0x000000d4 vaddr 0x080480d4 paddr 0x080480d4 align 2**0

         filesz 0x00000013 memsz 0x00000013 flags r--

    <STRONG>LOAD off    0x00000000 vaddr 0x08048000 paddr 0x08048000

align 2**12

         filesz 0x0000055c memsz 0x0000055c flags r-x</STRONG>

    LOAD off    0x0000055c vaddr 0x0804955c paddr 0x0804955c align 2**12

         filesz 0x000000d4 memsz 0x000000d8 flags rw-

 DYNAMIC off    0x00000598 vaddr 0x08049598 paddr 0x08049598 align 2**2

         filesz 0x00000098 memsz 0x00000098 flags rw-</SMALL></PRE>



<P>The code segment is present in the third element. Note that

alignment is 4096, the size

of each page of virtual memory. 



<UL>

  <LI><STRONG>Section headers</STRONG>: it's an array of more or less

standard elements, that

    makes more comprehensive the distribution of data and code. For

instance, the general

    &quot;data&quot; set can be split into read-only data, initialized

data, uninitialized

    data, etc ... But you can define non-standard sections if you feel

like, regarding the

    section should be mapped in one of the segments specified in the

program headers array.

    Each element is a structure that references the data/code by means

of a file offset. </LI>

</UL>



<P>This is just a reminding if someone have already read about elf

structure, i'm not

teaching elf structure. If you're lazy, as me, you will not want to

read the docs i

pointed before, but do not expect to understand the what i'm gonna

discuss now. </P>



<P>Now let's suppose i have a piece of code i want to add to the

program. I could think

about creating a new code section and append it. Ok, that's not

complicated, as you can do

it with a simple program named <EM>objcopy</EM>. The program comes with

the <EM>binutils</EM>

package, that every distribution carries. One of the features of

objcopy is to add a

section given a file name. </P>



<P>That sounds good, let's suppose i program my new code in C, i

compile it (i can link it

statically to ease the task), and then <EM>objcopy</EM> glues it to the

protected crap.

Well it works, but ... <EM>objcopy</EM> does nothing to map the new

section onto the

executable segment, where all the code is loaded. In other words my new

code is

unreachable, because it is never loaded. </P>



<P>A pity, but now you'll begin to realize the difficulties of the job,

you must edit by

yourself the elf headers and try to make your new section reachable

from the rest of the

code. Our code is not located physically contiguous to the rest of the

executable code: </P>

<P>I'm locating the new section as the last one, not only because it's

the easiest

solution, but it's the way <EM>objcopy</EM> does. The problem here is

that we can't

overlap segments (nor sections), so due to the fact you can't (AFAIK)

define two code

segments, you'll get nothing. The only thing you could do is expanding

the current code

section (<EM>.text</EM> section) and append at the end the new piece of

code. Of course

you'll have to expand the segment too, and other things i'll tell you

soon (that makes the

task a nightmare). </P>



<P>But before tackling the problems of expanding a <EM>.text</EM>

section, let's face the

problem of modifying elf files. <EM>Objcopy</EM> can handle section

attributes and so on,

but do not even think about modifying attributes from program headers: 



<UL>

  <LI><STRONG>By hand</STRONG>: The structures of elf files are defined

in the file <STRONG>/usr/include/elf.h</STRONG>.

    Knowing the meaning of each element (and you can achieve that

reading the document i told

    you above), it's just a programming problem. On the other hand is

really difficult to be

    aware of all the details a small modification implies in the rest

of the elements. I built

    small programs that list elf elements (that information is

available through objdump too),

    and modify particular elements. </LI>

</UL>



<HR>



<P>Now if somebody's interested on writing X-Windows apps (with some of

the new and

attractive graphic libraries for instance), a VERY USEFUL tool could be

to program a

graphical ELF editor, that could have as a &quot;maximum&quot;

challenge: insert data/code

into sections. If anybody has the guts to try it i could help him with

ELF details (if

necessary, of course). </P>



<HR>



<UL>

  <LI><STRONG>Using Libelf</STRONG>: yes a library to edit elf file is

available. That sounds

    good, but the rest is not so good. The lib was written by Michael

&quot;Tired&quot; Riepe,

    and it's a good work, a good incomplete work. The last version

(last update lot of months

    ago) i knew of was libelf-0.6.4. The library provides a fairly

complete API to deal with

    elf files ... but the problems is that there's no documentation at

all. Of course after

    delving a bit inside elf details, you can &quot;guess&quot; some of

the features of the

    functions, but you'll realize it's not the best way to accomplish

things. As a personal

    opinion i prefer to control by myself what i'm doing with the elf

file, especially if are

    going to read simple attributes. It doesn't mean libelf should not

be considered in some

    cases, in fact, reading elf headers, section headers and program

headers is really simple.

    But when you face more complicated jobs, as adding parts, you must

know for sure what the

    program is supposed to do (behind the scene) and what is not. Well,

you can always look up

    the source code ... :-) </LI>

</UL>



<UL>

  <LI><STRONG>Using BFD</STRONG>. What's that ? Well, you could find

that name playing with

    binutils source code, as it is used by the most important GNU

elements in your system (for

    instance debugger and linker). I don't know much about BFD but if

it is used in such

    packages is really a guaranty. BFD lets you manipulate different

object file formats

    (there are a lot if you wondered) in a common way. You work with a

common

    object-bfd-format and you must not care about elf details. I'm sure

mastering BFD you can

    do what you want with executables, but it seemed to me i had to

spend too much hours on it

    and I preferred to think about other ways. Again the docs are

partial, not updated and

    probably wrong :). </LI>

</UL>



<P>Ok, unless you could rebuild completely an executable with BFD,

you'll need

modifications in the elf header in order to expand <EM>.text</EM>

section. I think there

are two different groups of modifications you have to do, one more

obvious, and the second

more complicated: </P>



<P>&nbsp; 



<OL type="1">

  <LI>Let's suppose there are <STRONG><U>N</U></STRONG> sections, and

text section is number <U><STRONG>i</STRONG></U>.

    We are going to append our code, so you have to physically insert

it. You have to make

    modifications regarding program headers and section headers, in

order to make the new code

    &quot;fit&quot;:<BR>

    <OL type="i">

      <LI>The .text section and code segment must be larger. As much as

the size of the new code (<EM>sh_size,

        (and the suitable segments at program headers) must be

appropriately increased (<EM>p_vaddr,

        p_paddr, sh_addr</EM>).</LI>

  <LI>That was the easy part, i did it (don't include it because it's

not a very educational

    material, but you may ask for it if you want), but it's not enough

... it does not work.

    Why ? let's see a usual distribution of sections in an easy

program: </LI>

<P>If you look at some function present in the symbol table that is

dynamically loaded (<EM>printf</EM>

for instance), you'll get an address: </P>



<PRE><SMALL><FONT color="#8000FF">080483fc</FONT> DF *UND* 00000024

printf </SMALL></PRE>



<P>so <FONT color="#8000FF">80483fc</FONT> is the supposed address for

<STRONG>printf</STRONG>

in our program. There you'll not find <STRONG>printf's</STRONG> code,

but a jmp

[index_table]. The contents of the table are initialized by dynamic

loader. We see, we're

lucky because that address (<FONT color="#8000FF">80483fc</FONT>) is

from <EM>.plt</EM>

section, and that address is not modified by the insertion of the new

code. But if we go

on, we see: </P>



<PRE><SMALL><FONT color="#8000FF">080483fc</FONT> jmp *<FONT

color="#008000">0x804957c </SMALL></FONT></PRE>



<P>so the data table that keeps the real address of dynamic function,

located in section <EM>.got</EM>,

is disturbed by our patch. If we add, say 10k of code, *<FONT

color="#008040">0x804957c</FONT>

is not pointing <EM>.got</EM> section anymore. It is pointing some

innocent instruction

inside<EM> .text</EM> section. </P>



<P>You would need to patch <EM>.plt</EM> section, that could be big,

and well, i gave up

here. The problem is not unsolvable, may be patient programmer could do

:-). Anyway you'll

agree the procedure is getting more confused and less elegant. </P>



<P>&nbsp;</P>



<P><U><STRONG>2. TRACING A PROCESS</STRONG></U></P>



<P>The idea of this approach is taken from <EM>ltrace</EM> written by

Juan CÈspedes. What

he does is read symbol table and place breakpoints before calling

dynamically linked

functions. Read the stack, call the function and keep the returned

value. That job is

accomplished by ptrace, a system call that let you &quot;debug&quot; a

process. </P>



<P>What i want to do here is to patch code and data on the fly in order

to suit my needs:

change the calling parameter, create calling loops to validating

functions, ... The

program will know nothing :). Ptrace provides elements to modify

code/data, read

code/data, insert breakpoints, resume execution, trap signals, trap

system calls, etc ...

almost all you want. I'd like to remark that, WITH PTRACE YOU HAVE GOT

ALL THE POWER. </P>



<P>The main lacks for this approach are:

  <LI>It's <U>slow</U>. If you're trying a brute force approach you

need all the speed from

    you computer, and ptrace calls are not fast. Don't misunderstand,

may be just

    microseconds, but in some scenario it could be important. </LI>

  <LI>All my access to victim's <U>address space</U> is done via

ptrace. I cannot modify

    data/code directly, moreover i cannot jump directly to foreign code

nor return from it. Of

    course, i can give my own functions to be called on trap signals

and so one, but it's like

    a firewall that separates both processes. </LI>

</OL>



<P>It would be nice to manipulate the kernel and make the trick, but

that's far beyond my

available time ... and you'll see there are other alternatives. To get

this approach

closer to you let's see a simple piece of code dealing with ptrace. It

creates a child

process that will be debugged by its parent, then the child process

executes the victim

program. I will not explain what is a child/parent process, or how a

fork call works, but

there are thousands of books that will inform you. On the other hand i

would like to tell

you about a good guide for ptrace's call, but sadly i did not find it,

so consult man

page. </P>

<P><U><STRONG>3. MANIPULATING DYNAMIC LINKER</STRONG></U> </P>



<P>What we are trying to do is to write our own code and make it

visible from our victim's

code. We are trying to share our code, if you want to put that way. But

that is done

everyday with no artificial method: dynamic linker. So we are going to

try some trick or

otherwise try-to-emulate what the linker does. </P>



<P>The most obvious and easy trick, but not less powerful is the well

known <STRONG>LD_PRELOAD</STRONG>

trick. You can find it documented (though the procedure has to be tuned

:-) together with

dynamic liker (<EM>ld-so</EM>) source code. It was mentioned in

<EM>zlib</EM> package and

other docs too. The trick was also explained by

<STRONG><EM>adq</EM></STRONG> in a

previous essay. Anyway, as far as i've read it is always used to fake

some function

dynamically loaded, but never to access victim's code from the faked

function.</P>



<P>Example: </P>



<P>Suppose our evil program uses some common function as <EM>sin</EM>,

you could preload

it (via <STRONG>LD_PRELOAD</STRONG> env. variable) and load in memory

your

&quot;holy&quot; code. You could always resolve the problem of the

actual function along

with <EM>cos</EM> function, for example ;). Now pass (or hardwire) the

address of a

validating function to our preloaded library (or to our preloaded sin

function if you feel

like that), and patch the executable (physically or ptracing it) to

call the faked <EM>sin</EM>

function instead of the validating function. Then from your faked

function you

&quot;see&quot; the calling address space and you can call the

validating function a

zillion times until you get a good value, and you can then return to

the caller code :-).

You get ???? </P>

<P>I like the above method especially because it's fairly easy and is

the dynamic loader

the one who makes the dirty job of loading pages into memory. Moreover

the patching is

minimum, but it is good to know other alternatives, that will do more

or less what the

dynamic linker does in background. Keep in mind this easy method can

<U>only be used in

dynamic executables</U>, that although they are the most usual,

sometimes you find

statically linked ones. </P>



<P>Firstly you can try to load a library in a way similar to the way

you do in Windoze.

The most important drawback is that you need not only to overwrite code

from the

executable, but you need that the functions involved were previously

used by the program

(as far that they have to be present in the dynamic table). The

functions involved are: </P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P><EM><SMALL>void *<STRONG>dlopen</STRONG> (const char *filename,

int flag) </SMALL></EM></P>

  <P><EM><SMALL>void *<STRONG>dlsym</STRONG> (void *handle, char

*symbol)</SMALL></EM></P>

  <P><EM><SMALL>int <STRONG>dlclose</STRONG> (void *handle)

</SMALL></EM></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>so you will load by yourself (from the victim's code) a library and

get the address of

a particular function or symbol. The you can jump to it. </P>



<P>Another alternative, more sophisticated but easier to implement is

to introduce the

system call <EM>mmap</EM>. It is a very interesting service that maps a

file into memory

with the corresponding attributes. If you wondered is the way dynamic

loader

&quot;loads&quot; libraries into memory: </P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P><EM><SMALL>void * <STRONG>mmap</STRONG> (void *start, size_t

length, int prot , int

  flags, int fd, off_t offset); </SMALL></EM></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><EM>mmap</EM>, remember is a system call, no library is necessary.

It's a great gift

from kernel guys. The system call returns a pointer to the loaded area.

If you use in the

&quot;flag&quot; parameter the value MAP_FIXED, the parameter start

should indicate the

address where YOU WANT the code/data to be loaded. I didn't try yet,

but what about if you

overwrite the code previously loaded ... it would not work as it is

read-only data.. </P>
