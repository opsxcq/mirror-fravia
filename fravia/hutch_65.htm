<I>SLH is back again with another (the fifth) of his small masterpieces: You would be well advised to read 

all the preceding parts of what is going to be a DEFINITIVE HCU MANUAL INTRODUCING  

WINDOWS DISASSEMBLING: it's a concentrated <U>very good</U> 

course about the UTMOST IMPORTANCE of assembling 

in everyday windows (or whatever) programming. This will help you, among other 

things :-) in order to 

better understand 

the purposes (and the power) of what we are all doing here...<BR><BR>

> COLD STEEL

>

> The Eye Of The Warrior

>

> Depending on the story you read, Excalibur was handed to King Arthur by the

> Lady of the Lake to continue the quest of re-uniting his country, a task

> that his father had failed to achieve. Modern software warriors will have to

> do more than expect that their sword will be given to them.

>

> Sword making is one of the ancient arts based on the necessity of doing

> battle with a reliable weapon that would not break under the most severe

> conditions. In mediaeval Japan, the art of making the "Katana", the famous

> weapon of the Samurai, produced blades of considerable excellence seven

> hundred years before steel became commonly available through the Bessemer

> process.

>

> The skills involved were complex and difficult, forging, hardening,

> tempering, grinding, polishing through to the condition where the warrior

> had a weapon of excellence that would serve him through the tribulations of

> his profession.

>

> The modern software warrior must produce software that is sharp edged,

> flexible, light and well balanced to met the challenge that lays ahead.

>

> The "sword" offered by the RAD vendors has the appearance of greatness with

> a shiny blade, a beautifully engraved handle and an inlaid scabbard but when

> you pick it up it is too heavy (bloat), try to do combat with it and the

> blade gaps and snaps (GP faults), and when you try to fix it, the basic

> material is not good enough to repair.

>

> The programmers who has undertaken the quest to recover lost knowledge will

> have their API template hardened and tempered like the swords of legend,

> with the mastery of using the normal controls, menus and resources, the

> handle will be well shaped and securely attached, the next thing is to

> refine its appearance and sharpen the blade.

>

> The swordsmith at work.

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> One of the most irksome aspects of windows GUI programming is the percentage

> of development time spent designing the interface so that a programs user

> can interact with it in a convenient and predictable way. One of the curses

> of some of the old style DOS software was that the user needed to attend a

> course to learn how to interact with the program.

>

> One of the few things Microsoft got right was the standardisation of some

> of the interface characteristics so that the user did not have to start from

> scratch each time they started up a different program. The problem is that

> the extension of this standardisation became a straight jacket to the

> developer.

>

> A casual glance through some of the software currently on the market says

> much about the environment it was developed in, the proliferation of

> dockable toolbars says Microsoft visual C++, the endless manipulation of

> icons and font listings says one of the versions of visual basic, dialog

> boxes and buttons from BWCC & BWCC32 DLLs reveal Borland origin yet the

> programmer who masters the lower level functions in the API does not have

> to wear the straight jacket imposed by the corporate vendors.

>

> Interface design, when freed from the gimmicks, has a very useful function

> in making the software easier to understand and use and there are a number

> of ways of getting the majority of desired characteristics without either

> the bloat or the gimmicks.

>

> To fuel the glitzy front end of Win Doze 95, Microsoft sneaked in a couple

> of new styles for buttons where you can either use bitmaps or icons as the

> button's image. This considerably simplifies bitmap buttons from the days

> when owner draw buttons were the only way of getting an image onto a button.

>

> Icons are easier to use because of the routine capacity to include

> transparent backgrounds in the image which means that they do not interfere

> with the background colour of the button but they come in less than useful

> square shapes and set sizes.

>

> Bitmaps have the advantage of being able to be loaded at any size and shape

> but it comes with a catch, images saved as bitmaps hard code the background

> colours into the file which will clash with a different colour set by the

> user in their 3Dobject option. Fortunately, there is a solution to the

> problem that only takes a little coding to solve.

>

> Write a function that creates a button that has the additional BS_BITMAP

> included something like as follows.

>

>     FUNCTION = CreateWindow("BUTTON","", _

>                             WS_VISIBLE or WS_CHILD or BS_BITMAP, _

>                             x,y,wd,ht,hParent,ID,hInstance,0)

>

> The return value is the handle to the button. After you have created the

> bitmap and compiled it into your resource file, call your button function,

>

>     hBtn1 = BmpButton(5,5,55,25,hWnd,110)

>

> When you set the size of the button, make sure you allow a couple of pixels

> each side for the button's border. Then you load the bitmap from the

> resource file,

>

>     hBmp = LoadBitmap(hInstance,"MYBITMAP")

>

> To solve the problem of clashing background colour, a function has been

> included at the end of this document that reads the background colour of

> your bitmap and uses ExtFloodFill() to change it to the colour of the button

> face. You call it as follows,

>

>     hBmp = SetBmpColor(hBmp)

>

>   passing the handle of the resource bitmap and receiving back the same

> handle to the bitmap after it has been modified. All that needs to be done

> after this is to send the following message to the button,

>

>     SendMessage hBtn1,BM_SETIMAGE,0,hBmp

>

>   and you bitmap button is up and running with the correct background

> colour. This means that once you have the functions up and going, you do a

> bitmap button in four lines of code which is a damned site quicker than

> slopping a button onto a form and then ratting around to find the bitmap

> that you want to pour into it.

>

> This process works just as well on the strip bitmaps used in the toolbar

> controls. All you need to ensure is that the bitmap has a "path" for the

> floodfill function to access all of the background colour. One of those

> little secrets that nobody tells you is that PaintBrush is a leading edge

> toy for drawing toolbar and button bitmaps. Excellent for manipulating

> text for 3D shadow effects.

>

> An important thing when using resources is to delete them when finished.

> Somewhere in your exit code you make a corresponding call to,

>

>     DeleteObject hBmp

>

> A good habit to learn is when you allocate a resource, you also write the

> code to de-allocate it otherwise you application will leak like a sieve.

>

> While allocated bitmap resources are usually recovered when the program

> exits, using GDI function for screen display is critical in the recovery

> of brushes, pens and images, otherwise the resource waste can bring the

> application to a halt as the system runs out of GDI memory.

>

> This is the windows programmer's law of gravity, what goes up must come

> down, forget it and it will come down around your ears with a crash.

>

> Sharpening the blade

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> From the Italian Renaissance masters to the portrait painters of modern

> times, the difference between a flat and lifeless painting and a painting

> that revealed more than the subject often desired was the gradient of light

> to shadow.

>

> In a different and restricted way, the programmer needs to master the

> capacity that is available to give their software the illusion of dimension

> so that its user more easily comprehends the subtleties of the interface.

>

> Some of this has been made easier through the additional styles available

> in CreateWindowEx(). Include the WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE style in either the main

> window or a control and you have a consistent 3D border around the control

> or window.

>

> For more control laying out the interface, you write a function that is

> called by the WM_PAINT message in the WndProc message handling function. In

> designing this function, you would pass it both the window handle and the

> device context handle as both values are useful.

>

> There is a windows API called DrawEdge() that allows the programmer to do

> a wide range of lines and frames in the system colour and size anywhere in

> the client area of the application. This will extend the interface capacity

> but the function is not particularly fast or flexible.

>

> There is a better way that is based on the not so well kept secret that to

> provide the glitzy front end for win 95, Microsoft had to hard code a lot of

> the GDI in assembler. There are a complimentary pair of functions called

> respectively MoveToEx() and LineTo() that when used with a single pixel wide

> pen, are genuinely fast.

>

> There are two functions at the end of this document that use these two APIs

> to draw lines and frames and they have the advantage that if you provide the

> device context, they will draw on anything. They are respectively,

>

>     DrawLine() and Frame3D().

>

> These two functions have passed the test of time in that they were

> originally written in 16 bit windows C and were fast enough then to provide

> the framing and other line drawing for 3D layouts when there was no other

> choice.

>

> In 32 bit windows, they provide considerable power and flexibility to draw

> frames around groups of controls, frames around windows that adjust

> dynamically when the window is resized, or in fact, anything you like.

>

> To use them efficiently, you need to provide the dimensions for the frames

> and it is here where a couple of the information retrieval functions are

> very useful. Using a RECT structure / Data Type and filling it with the

> GetClientRect() gives you the width and height of the client area which you

> then use to provide the dimensions for the frames around the client area.

>

> Retrieving the dimensions of a control in the client area involves using

> two functions, GetWindowRect() will give you the dimensions in absolute

> screen co-ordinates, then you use ScreenToClient() to convert the top left

> co-ordinate to a client area position. In C you use a POINT structure to

> convert this information, in basic you use a POINTL data type.

>

> Once you have the dimensions of the area you wish to frame, the Frame3D()

> function was written so that the four co-ordinates could be incremented or

> decremented to easily step successive frames.

>

> Work out how far you want the frame from the controls in pixels and then

> subtract that value from the top x and top y co-ordinates and add that

> value to the lower x and lower y co-ordinate.

>

> Call this value "Step".

>

>     LOCAL Step as LONG

>     LOCAL hi   as LONG

>     LOCAL lo   as LONG

>

>     hi=GetSysColor(COLOR_3DHIGHLIGHT)

>     lo=GetSysColor(COLOR_3DSHADOW)

>

>     Step = 5

>     Void = Frame3D(hDC,hi,lo,tx-Step,ty-Step,lx+Step,ly+Step,1)

>

> To make the next frame, you simply copy the proceeding two lines of code,

> reverse the two colour parameters and increment the step parameter.

>

>     Step = 8

>     Void = Frame3D(hDC,lo,hi,tx-Step,ty-Step,lx+Step,ly+Step,1)

>

> Inlining the function calls this way is the fastest way to do it and the

> overhead is trivial.

>

> Juggling the border width parameter allows you to give the illusion of

> height change so that you can provide a "sculptured" appearance in the areas

> that you wish to highlight. Overdo it and your interface can look like a

> cluttered mess but get it right and you have busted out of the straight

> jacket that Microsoft have implemented in win 95.

>

> This technique called from the WM_PAINT message gives you persistent objects

> for the price of a few function calls which are like lightning instead of

> having to load some junkheap DLL to get a control to do the same thing.

>

> Decorating the handle

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> Some image data is too complex to generate any other way than the use of

> bitmaps that are usually drawn externally in image editors. You would

> normally expect that a GUI based operating system would have a function that

> would display an image where you wanted it but it just does not exist, you

> have to write the code to display an image using low level functions out of

> the GDI.

>

> At low level, the process is not all that difficult, as long as you

> understand what the mechanics of the technique are. If you wish to display

> a bitmap on part of the client area, first you get the device context with

> the function call GetDC(hWnd). Then you create a memory device context using

>

>     mDC=CreateCompatibleDC(NULL)

>

>   select your bitmap into that memory device context using the following,

>

>     hOldBmp=SelectObject(mDC,hBitmap)

>

> and you can do almost anything you like with it. You can use GDI functions

> to either modify it or draw on it and then when you have done the processing

> that you want, you "blit" it onto the client area at whatever location you

> want. For size for size "blitting" you use BitBlt() - Bit Blit, and for size

> change up or down you use StretchBlt() - Stretch Blit.

>

> The last parameter in both functions give you a range of very useful options

> for the method in which you display the image.

>

> Conceptually, the idea of creating a memory device context is something like

> creating an invisible piece of screen that you can load images onto and use

> GDI functions to draw on. The "blit" functions are fast enough to use this

> technique for animation which is generally how it is done.

>

> If you want an image to be a persistent object, simply call the code to

> display it from you function that is called from the WM_PAINT message and

> it will remain visible after other windows have overlapped it or your own

> window has been minimised or maximised.

>

> This is particularly useful if you wish to display a logo on part of the

> client area. It is easy to frame your logo using the framing function

> supplied and you do not need a control to do it.

>

> One of the sobering facts that you will face is that even a moderate use of

> bitmap data will use more disk and memory space than the functions used to

> manipulate them at low level but this is part of the price you pay for

> working in a graphical environment.

>

> The difference is that by writing your code at low level, you have not

> produced the bloat that is associated with RAD front ends and you have near

> absolute control over the layout and appearance of your interface.

>

> With the mastery of interface layout and design, the low level programmer

> is very close to where the action is, a mimimum size window and messaging

> footprint, the range of standard controls that can be pelted around at

> rates that scare the uninitiated and finally the nearly unlimited control

> of the appearance of the interface.

>

> What the low level programmer is doing is much the same as the RAD system

> designer in packaging groups of low level functions together as larger high

> level functions, the difference is that instead of producing a big, slow,

> sloppy compromise with its restrictions, leaks and bugs, the low level

> programmer selects exactly what is needed and no more which accounts for

> the dramatic difference in size.

>

> This is related to a well known problem in static library design, a problem

> called granularity. If you write each low level function as a seperate

> module, it takes a bit more work and you risk carrying a little more

> overhead in the function calls but on the other end, if a large number of

> functions are included in the same module, when you call one, you get the

> code for the rest as well.

>

> At its worst, it means that if you call a function that may only have a

> couple of hundred bytes in it, you get a mountain of junk attached to it

> which is not used by your program. This is something like an olympic runner

> competing with an anvil tied around their neck.

>

> There is no reason in terms of code generation why these RAD systems are so
