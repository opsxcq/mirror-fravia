<CENTER><I>Good old +Mammon_! He should work MUCH more on this kind of fascinating stuff! Here,

 not enough, and his assertion: </I>"<FONT color=purple>In the name of brevity, laziness, and

speranda sunt.<BR>Many years ago I remember having read a science fiction novel where an 

astroship (from 

earth, duh) landed on an alien planet where cars were noisy and slow and cumbersome but LOOKED nice and fast and 

rational, and the lusers driving them didn't notice it at all (quite the contrary: last 'trends' were soo greaat :-) so to 

say the "last 

stadium" of the "USA 

today syndrome" +Mammon_ speaks about... Hey! Am I mistaken or today's cars are always 

<U>too hot</U> because of the wind-tunnel aerodynamic of their glass panels? Old cars, 

in the fifties, were much cooler, if less "aerodynamically correct" because their 

glass panels were NOT idiotically oblique... just try one of those old-fashioned black (beautifully functional)

how oft can you 

roam and run your "aerodynamical" car as if you were inside a wind tunnel? You mostly don't run inside wind 

tunnels at all, you stupid sod: despite advertising you are NOT running on a lonesome winding country route 

without nobody else in sight but trees and flowers (see the Goebbelsian "car ads" on your 

own favourite magazines... how oft do they actually show 

you that nice car "you should 

buy" routinely 

crushed to snailvelocity inside millions of "fellow 

commuters" on your usual congested 

motorroad?) So you'r not running much around at 180 Kmperhour...<BR>And, come to think of it in July, 

how oft -instead- would you wish you were sitting in a cooler car?...<BR> 

I have forgotten the title of that old SF-novel... those alien cars did not work well and 

those stupid aliens did not notice 

it, funny story indeed... anyone remembers its Author?<BR>I spoke too much, sorry: that's because I'm stimulated and 

moved by this essay... and I agree with +Mammon_'s severe 'Urteil': </I>"<FONT color=purple>Homo Consumerus is a slow-sitted, lazy beast

that requires constant distraction from its surroundings before it will consent to

being milked; its bovine nature, however, makes it quite easy to placate.</FONT>". <I>Enjoy

                 <BR>

                 <P>

                 In the early 1980's, at the start of the Age of Greed Apparent, amidst 

                 media glut, fading

                 nationalism, and the growing awareness that private -- as opposed to 

                 political or national --

                 interests were determining government policy, the <I>cyberpunk</I> 

                 movement was born.  By

                 origin an SF literary sub-genre that spread "underground" through film, 

                 music, art, and

                 gaming channels, cyberpunk presented a cynical view of the future of 

                 technology,

                 characterized by zaibatsu, high-tech lowlifes, and media culture. 

                 Fifteen years later a

                 passing glance at the world shows the zaibatsu struggling for power

                 with 

                 provincial and 

                 global regulatory agencies, an expanding arsenal of cheap and portable 

                 "street level" 

                 technology, and a patently mass-media oriented global culture.<P>

                 The bulk of information traffic through mainstream media channels is 

                 prepared for public

                 consumption according to formulas derived from Goebbels, Ellul,

                 McLuhan, 

                 and other pioneers

                 in the fields of propaganda and mass communication. In the mass media 

                 industry, the end

                 "product" is becoming farther and farther removed from the source 

                 material that inspired

                 it; while in the case of entertainment "product" this simply results in 

                 the production of

                 programs that are banal and virtually indistinguishable from each other 

                 on a narrative level,

                 in the case of news "product" this can result in an abridgement, 

                 excision, or even a

                 misinterpretation of factual information. It is for this reason 

                 imperative that any party

                 interested in the pursuit of knowledge--that being factual, empirical 

                 knowledge, as

                 opposed to a simple, placative "answer"--become versed in the analytic 

                 tools necessary to

                 cull real information from the vast sources of <I>disinformation</I> 

                 being peddled as "facts".

                 <BR>

                 <B>Print Periodicals</B><P>

                 Events which need not be related here led to the impromptu

                 demonstration 

                 of three very

                 rudimentary techniques used in the print media to affect the attention 

                 and perception of the

                 reader. These techniques should serve as an introduction to the "mind 

                 behind the magazine",

                 and should demonstrate also the proper frame of mind in which a 

                 periodical is to be read

                 critically. In the name of brevity, laziness, and the fact that 

                 mainstream news periodicals

                 are generally distasteful, only one demonstration has been provided for 

                 each technique;

                 readers are encouraged to contribute further examples from their own 

                 experience. <P>



                 <B>Hide-and-seek Articles</B> There is a disturbing tendency for 

                 periodicals to "hide"

                 their articles amongst a number of full page ads, making the odds of 

                 randomly opening the

                 periodical to a page with an ad equal to or greater than (>=) the

                 chance 

                 or opening to

                 an article. There are two basic tricks to this: moving the table of 

                 contents a random number 

                 of pages into the magazine (often 2-6), and not displaying page numbers 

                 on non-article pages. The first

                 forces the reader to view ads simply to find out what is in the 

                 periodical; the second forces the reader

                 to view ads when searching for an article--the search for an article in 

                 effect becomes a

                 search for page numbers, often ending up in the reader finding a page 

                 number, then counting

                 the number of pages until the next page number, simply in order to get 

                 their bearings within

                 the magazine. Note that even more subtle variations of this technique 

                 may be used within

                 articles through the use of half- and quarter-page ads which interrupt 

                 the reader's

                 standard left-right/top-down order of reading.

                 <P>

                 <U>Case Study 1: <I>Business Week</I> June 29, 1998</U> To start off 

                 with, the table of

                 contents for this periodical is found after two dual-page ads (the

                 first 

                 for Novell, the 

                 second for Hoechst) and is numbered as page four, indicating that 

                 publishers like 

                 programmers start counting at 0. The target article, "Is your car 

                 smarter than you?" in 

                 the <I>Science & Technology</I> section, is listed as starting on page 

                 85. Experiment: 

                 open the mag in about the middle, you see a psuedo-article ("Special 

                 Advertising Section" for the

                 U.S. Open) called "The World Golf Village" and a facing ad for Royal & 

                 Sunalliance. Objective: 

                 search for a page number. Flip back 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pages... a column 

                 called "The Corporation", 

                 no page number. Go back to the starting point, turn forward 1, 2, 3, 4, 

                 5 pages...finally 

                 a page number, coincidentally also the first page of the article, 85. 

                 Deeper investigation 

                 reveals that between pages 63 and 85 there are no page numbers.<P>

                 <B>The <I>USA Today</I> Syndrome</B> This should come as no surprise in 

                 the modern "visual"

                 age: people prefer to have information presented to them graphically. 

                 The "<I>USA Today</I> 

                 Syndrome" is a term that refers to the presentation of news or 

                 information in a format that 

                 is not only graphic but simplistic--for example pie charts with no hard 

                 information, maps

                 of "trouble spots" with no geographic information, technical drawings 

                 with no technology in

                 them. A bit of experience with journals (the serious quarterly ones

                 that 

                 one rarely finds 

                 outside of libraries, as opposed to a weekly or monthly "journal" from 

                 the news vendor) will

                 demonstrate that one can use charts and graphs to efficiently present 

                 large amounts of data

                 (note that those large amounts of data must be present), that maps can 

                 contain topographical

                 information which may contribute to one's understanding of why so many 

                 "trouble spots" 

                 (fires, famines, murders, etc) are occuring in such a specific area and 

                 not in others, and

                 that depictions of actual electronic or mechanical components can 

                 demonstrate a leap in

                 technology as adequately as a dicussion of those components. Failure to 

                 include full data

                 in a graphic such as those mentioned is one of the prime symptoms of

                 the 

                 "<I>USA Today</I> 

                 Syndrome", and in the case of these three graphic methods indicates

                 that 

                 1) there is not a

                 large enough amount of data known to justify a chart/graph, 2) there is 

                 not enough information

                 known about the topography of the mapped area or the incidents 

                 themselves cannot be placed in

                 a specific, definite area on the map, and 3) the actual electronic or 

                 mechanical components

                 either are not known or do not exist.

                 <U>Case Study 1: <I>Business Week</I> June 29, 1998</U> The "Is your

                 car 

                 smarter than you?" 

                 article has two "USA Today-esque" features: a cutaway car view on page 

                 85 and a "Cars get

                 Siliconized" graph on page 86. The graph is useless and trivial, a 

                 y-axis of dollars (cost

                 of semiconductors per vehicle) from 0 to 300 and an x-axis of years

                 from 

                 '92 to '01; the

                 cost starts at $50 in 1992 and ends at $275 in 2001--useless knowledge, 

                 the price of chips

                 in auto manufacture, but potentially indicative of the article's claim, 

                 that the trend

                 towards computerization of cars is increasing (interestingly enough the 

                 graph is a steady 

                 slope, indicating no "increasing trend" but rather a "consistent 

                 trend"). The cutaway

                 graphic, however, deserves more treatment. The car is teal (very easy

                 on 

                 the eye) with

                 15 numbered details that are referred to (though not altogether 

                 explained) in the caption. 

                 The caption labels the detail-items with  high-tech descriptions that 

                 are somewhat clarified

                 in the article, however the illustrations of these technological 

                 advances is simplistic to 

                 the  point of being insulting: "By-wire steering" is the label affixed 

                 to a picture of a 

                 circle (steering wheel) and cylinder (steering column); the  "60 

                 microprocessors" are a cube 

                 the size of a Car Wars power plant behind the  back seat, the 

                 "yaw-and-pitch sensor" is a

                 cube on the dashboard, and the worst of the lot is an advanced 

                 acceleration system labelled 

                 "acceleration" and depicted in the graphic by a thin rectangle (gas 

                 pedal).This is <I>not</I>

                 a technical drawing, it bears no relation to the text other than by 

                 scattering a random

                 sampling of keywords across an amorphous depiction of a car, and it

                 does 

                 nothing to

                 illustrate or illuminate points made in the article.<P>

                 <B>Science Fiction - Science Fact</B> As devotees of the venerated 

                 <I>Analog</I> magazine

                 will attest, there is a great difference between "science fiction" and 

                 "science fact".

                 The term "science fiction" is used to refer to a literary device in 

                 which the author

                 extrapolates--hopefully with a sound scientific or technological 

                 background--the existence or

                 application of various technologies; usually this is to provide greater 

                 narrative berth, or

                 to sound out implications of a new or theorized technology. The term 

                 "science fact" is used to

                 refer to "cutting-edge" technologies that exist in theory or in 

                 practice. It is quite commonplace

                 for technical articles in mainstream magazines to devoid themselves of 

                 any "science fact", thus

                 making them read as "science fiction"--that is, the visions or 

                 propaganda of various technological

                 industries. Technical articles that lack a certain degree of verifiable 

                 scientific or technical

                 information are bound to confuse the scientifically aware reader, by 

                 presenting a premise for

                 the existence or potential existence of a technology without any actual 

                 proof of its existence.

                 <U>Case Study 1: <I>Business Week</I> June 29, 1998</U> The "Is your

                 car 

                 smarter than you?" 

                 article once again. A brief sample of the technical illumination 

                 supplied by the article:

                 "In 'by-wire' systems, when a driver turns the steering wheel or stomps 

                 on 

                 the brake, the movement doesn't directly turn the wheels or apply the 

                 brakes as it used to. 

                 Instead, the motion is detected by sensors and relayed to computer 

                 chips. These chips then 

                 signal motors to turn the wheels or activate the brakes. Once 

                 microprocessors entered such 

                 control loops, they brought the ability to do more than just relay the 

                 driver's intent. They 

                 could embellish it with intelligence." Again: "With a different set of 

                 sensors and motors, 

                 the way a car rides can adapt to road-surface changes on a 

                 second-by-second basis. Other 

                 sensors will surround cars with an early-warning cocoon. Infrared 

                 detectors can spot the heat

                 of a car in the blind spot and sound an alarm when you flick the turn 

                 signal before changing 

                 lanes." The key here is such technical jargon as "chips", "motors", 

                 "sensors", and 

                 "microprocessors"; even the Barsoom stories had more scientific 

                 explanations of equipment. 

                 What is not covered is any actual discussion of the technology

                 involved. 

                 How are these 

                 sensors going to keep from being damaged by dust, rattle, age, etc? 

                 While the increased 

                 emissions (non-chemical) from vehicles interfere with their own 

                 instruments? How long will 

                 the average operating life of a car be with these enhancements as 

                 opposed to without them, 

                 especially since car stereos seem to wear down after 3-5 years of 

                 vibration and hard turns? 

                 What happens when the car loses power? Will the IR sensors be impaired 

                 at high speeds due 

                 to their proximity to an internal combustion engine? Why does this 

                 article create more 

                 questions than it answers?<P>

                 <B>Concluding Notes</B><P>

                 There are plenty of similar techniques in use by print and graphic 

                 media. The sad part about

                 the whole affair is that there is no national/global conspiracy to 

                 deprive the masses of

                 information; rather, this is the result of decades of stimulus-reponse 

                 testing conducted

                 by media companies and researchers when they monitor audience response 

                 through sales,

                 surveys, and public or private feedback (usually in that order). The 

                 "media industry", if

                 you will, has a "target" for everything it produces; the more general 

                 the target, the

                 greater the sales potential. To appeal to the most general target (the 

                 "masses") you must

                 shoot for the lowest common denominator--the slowest one in the herd, 

                 the sickest and oldest

                 and most banal antelope. Mass-market periodicals (and even paperbacks 

                 and television shows) are

                 targetted at anyone with a grade 7 education (age 12), while newspapers 

                 target anyone with a

                 grade 3 education (age 8). <P>

                 The consumer as targetted by the media industry is a mindless beast. 

                 Extensive media analysis

                 has shown that violence, porn, and celebrities--all means of vicarious 

                 living for the masses--

                 sell like nothing else. Compounding the effect are the short attention 

                 span acquired through

                 years of media overstimulation, and the quickly fading memory resulting 

                 from information overload

                 or saturation and from the general distraction/escapism offered by 

                 various media channels in

                 public and private life. In the end the audience for any mainstream 

                 publication is appeased by

                 quick, unrelated stories that require no further investigation, no 

                 background knowledge for full

                 comprehension ("<I>never</I> confuse them with facts"), no 

                 self-interrogation to determine one's

                 opinion on a matter. <I>Homo Consumerus</I> is a slow-sitted, lazy

                 beast 

                 that requires constant

                 distraction from its surroundings before it will consent to being 

                 milked; its bovine nature, however,

                 makes it quite easy to placate.

                 <B>Appendix: Towards a Reversing Toolkit</B><P>

                 The term "reversing" is used rather than cracking for the simple reason 

                 that cracking is

                 simply a crude application of reversing; often, as the Hiew manual 

                 states, a matter of

                 "changing 07xh to EBxh". Obviously a reversing toolkit for reality

                 would 

                 require coverage

                 of media analysis, fundamental logical and critical skills, an 

                 introduction to varied

                 frames of reference ("mode x") and the means to switch between them,

                 and 

                 an inspiration

                 to search for knowledge. At this stage only a few pointers can be given 

                 in follow-through

                 for the preceding work.<P>

                 Advertisers, producers, and artists will all try to circumvent your 

                 conscious will by

                 taking advantage of the following "loopholes" in the individual:

                 <LI><I>Need Sniffers</I> Based on the hierarchy of needs as defined by 

                 Abraham Maslow, these

                 methods will attempt to find or create an unfilled need and then offer

                 a 

                 product to fill it.

                 Examples include dandruff shampoo, anti-static-cling sheets ("fabric 

                 softeners"), and the film

                 "How to Get Ahead In Advertising".

                 <LI><I>Nature Bugs</I> There are a few base methods that attempt to

                 take 

                 advantage or biological

                 bugs inherent in the human design; often pattern-matching, color, and 

                 mood manipulations are used,

                 although more specific methods are often directed at sexuality, 

                 dominance/power ("alpha male")

                 status, and territorial acquisition/defense.

                 <LI><I>Attention Spoof</I> This is a subset of the Nature Bugs: 

                 essentially it takes advantage

                 of a survival trait--the ability to notice and respond to changes in

                 the 

                 environment, which is a

                 form of pattern "non-matching"--to attract the sensory perception (and 

                 therefore, the theory goes, 

                 the conscious or subconscious attention) of the individual. This

                 usually 

                 takes the form of 

                 flashing or flickering images, constant changes in light frequency or 

                 sound tone and volume, or

                 bright/clashing colours. Examples include the HTML "BLINK" tag, banner 

                 ads, and sleep deprivation 

                 techniques used on POWs.

                 <LI><I>Habit Exploits</I> If the target audience has a common

                 background 

                 --usually in education,

                 military, entertainment, or religion-- then habits or traditions common 

                 to that background

                 can be exploited to force the audience to react or perceive without its 

                 conscious knowledge. Examples based on

                 Western Eurporean/American reading would be the habitual interspersing 

                 of images/irrelevant text

                 in the left-right/up-down read order of relevant text, or the 

                 contra-habitual placing of white

                 text on black background to distinguish the text from all others.
