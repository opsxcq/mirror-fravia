> THE BRIDGE

>

> In Pursuit Of Lost Knowledge

>

> During the French occupation of Egypt, workmen in 1797 found an ancient

> stone with three different styles of inscription on it. It became known as

> the Rosetta Stone. The top style was written in Egyptian hieroglyphics, a

> set of symbols that no one had been able to read since antiquity. The second

> script was known as Demotic script which was partially understood and the

> third style was written in ancient Greek, a language that was very well

> understood.

>

> A young French scholar by the name of Jean Francois Champollion recognised

> the name of Ptolemy, an Egyptian Pharoah of Greek origin in the part of the

> inscription written in Greek. With research, comparison with other sources

> and persistence, he eventually pulled off one of the greatest "cracks" of

> all time, the recovery of the Egyptian hieroglyphics that had been entirely

> lost for over 1500 years.

>

> The capacity to "crack" the language that was fast becoming the "Egyptian

> hieroglyphics" of application programming is just within range of

> application programming through an anachronism that still survives in some

> of the high level languages, the capacity to write inline assembler.

>

> Of the major programming environments that still survive in one form or

> another, none are without hope when it comes to being used as a bridge to

> regain lost knowledge.

>

> Some are just more difficult than others. There are still dialects of C that

> will write inline assembler. Borland in its rise from the ashes of the last

> rape and pillage by Microsoft still support inline assembler in their latest

> version of Delphi 3.

>

> Even Visual Basic 5 is not without hope in this area. Most who have had to

> suffer this abomination have learnt that if you want performance in VB, you

> went looking in the aftermarket.

>

> A small Californian Company called PowerBasic has a product marketed under

> the name of PBDLL50 that allows the basic programmer to write dynamic link

> libraries using among other things, a quality 32 bit inline assembler.

>

> The purpose of seeking a bridge is to use existing skills in the language

> of choice to recover the things that once were common knowledge in the

> programming community, the use of assembly language where performance was

> needed.

>

> Interestingly enough, the assembler notation that is commonly used is two

> layers up from where the action is inside the processor. At the lowest

> level, binary is switching on and off banks of zeros and ones. There is a

> notation for using it but it is truly, only for the hardy. The first usable

> form of opcodes is in the more familiar hex notation that is seen in a hex

> editor.

>

> This is still a relatively difficult way to write binary for while the

> character data occurs in left to right order, because of a peculiarity in

> the design of Intel processors, numerical data is stored in reverse order.

>

> To copy a 32 bit hex value (56 A7 00 FE) into the eax register, you will

> find the opcode, A1 (mov eax) followed by (FE 00 A7 56).

>

>     A1 FE 00 A7 56

>

> While this is a high precision area to edit binary, it could only be classed

> as somewhat less than intuitive when it comes to software production.

>

> To aid in the production of software, a higher level language was developed

> to make the production of binary more managable and this is the place for

> assembler language.

>

> In the assembler module, you will have a data type declaration of the type

> DWORD or the traditional notation DD which ensures the data is the correct

> size. If you call it Var1, when you copy that piece of data into the eax

> register, you simply use [ mov eax, Var1 ] instead of [ A1 FE 00 A7 56 ].

>

> The other major simplification is the use of the commands that are referred

> to as mnemonics. The actual opcodes are different depending on the size and

> direction in which data is being copied.

>

>     mov eax, Var1 = A1

>     mov Var1, eax = A3

>

> The mnemonics give you a far more intuitive way of writing binary without

> any loss in precision. This is in the genuine sense of the term, a high

> level language but The difference is that when you write code in assembler,

> there is an exact correlation between what you write and what you get in

> binary.

>

> The Inline Assembler

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> Inline ASM notation varies from one language to another yet they are similar

> enough to the known assemblers to function as a vehicle to bridge the gap

> between the corporate "haves" and the aplication programming "have nots".

>

>     In C, you use an asm block,

>

>         __asm

>              {

>              mov eax, 0

>              etc ...

>              }

>

>     In Delphi you use the ASM statement,

>

>         "asm AsmStatement [ Separator AsmStatement ] end"

>

>     which allows the more orthodox looking,

>

>         asm

>           mov eax, 0

>           Statement ...

>           Statement ...

>         end

>

>     In PowerBasic you use the notation,

>

>         ! mov eax, 0

>         ! etc ...

>

> The place to start trying out inline assembler is in your speed dependent

> code. This can be a very wide range of application types ranging from CAD

> style number crunching to spreadsheet style calculations to graphic image

> processing and many more.

>

> To help you there is a very useful Windows API called GetTickCount. The

> piece of pseudo code following shows how it is useful as a simple but

> powerful performance barometer. Get your function up and going and then

> clock it as follows.

>

>     Local tc1 as LONG

>     Local tc2 as LONG

>     Local mil as LONG

>

>     tc1 = GetTickCount()

>       Call_Your_Speed_Dependent_Function

>     tc2 = GetTickCount()

>

>     mil = tc2 - tc1

>

> Convert mil to text and put it in a MessageBox and you will get the bad news

> about what is happening. Run it a number of times to get the fastest time

> because of ram buffering and then start on the speed dependent function. If

> you are writing this process for VB, make sure you put the GetTickCount()

> API call in the DLL, not in VB.

>

> Structured loops are often one of the culprits in wasting machine cycles.

> Although it may not be politically "correct" programming for some, the most

> efficient loop in terms of processor cycles is,

>

>     Label:

>       instruction ...

>       instruction ...

>       instruction ...

>       etc ...

>     jmp Label

>

> The next trick is to look at the exit condition for the loop and see if you

> can optimise it. The following is a mixed API, ASM win95 loop.

>

>     FastLoop: <X=DoApiFunc(Msg,NULL,0,0)    |

>       jnz FastLoop ----------------->

> If the length of the code within the loop exceeds 128 bytes, the code will

> need to be modified slightly because a short jump has a limit of 128 bytes
