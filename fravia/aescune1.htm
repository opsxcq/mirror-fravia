<I>Well, Aesculapius is back, and he is pretty crossed... somebody 

has annoyed him. He opens with a &quot;war declaration&quot; against harassing protectionists... Tsch, tsch...<BR>

I like Ultraedit a lot, it's a very good program, and I'm seriously thinking 

to buy it (when my ALLOWED 45 days trial will be finished, of course)... the only thing that 

really annoys me about Uedit is the completely nut &quot;thank-god page&quot; of its 

Author Mead... man, I have never seen something so crazy, you won't believe it 

until you <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.idmcomp.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.idmcomp.com/'" tppabs="http://www.idmcomp.com/">read it</A> :-)<BR>Anyway I like this program a lot, and therefore I have checked 

the situation before releasing this essay (that explains the delay, Aescu) and found out that the target is already 

irremediably compromised: there are at least 

6 different ready made cracks for version 5.0 (this target here explained by Aesculapius 

to-day) all over the web and, as if those were not enough, there are 

hundreds of 'regged' userid/registration 

combinations, the most common one being the ubiquitous userID: &quot;<FONT color="red">lxcore97</FONT>&quot; 

(no, I won't give you the 16-chars registration code as well... how many time d'I have to 

repeat it: LEARN HOW TO REVERSE YOUR TARGETS, don't use ready made code like thiefs and 

lusers... the whole fun is to reverse our targets, to 'earn' them somehow even if we won't use 

them... if you are here in order 

to find some software for free you have chosen a damn complicated way to get 

at it... you better jump over to the 'warez-world', farewell).<BR>

So I checked, and this good program is everywhere to have, regged, for free. I think therefore that 

Aesculapius work, far from damaging him, can actually be USEFUL to Ian Mead... here is the point he 

should take care of:</I></CENTER><PRE>however, the program still has to read the registration file to 

gather its initiation values, so a bpx on readfile should be enough to find 

a fairly close entry point to it

</PRE><I><CENTER>Learn here 

from Aesculapius how this protection scheme works. It's interesting and the keygenerator in asm at the 

bottom can easily be modified for other targets. If you crack Ultraedit register it 

after 45 days, it deserves it (IMHO). Enjoy!

	Well, I've been retired for a while due to heavy censoring, however 

I think the best way to solve this problem is facing it, striking back. 

All the programs which protection scheme I have only cracked, will be 

extensively explained so even a less than 50 IQ lamer will be able to 

defeat them; if this harassment continues, I'll then apply some virii 

techniques to the cracks which will ruin any protection scheme making it 

totally useless, the apps will be cracked without the user even noticing 

it, and eventually a gorgeous computer virus will be released to strike my 

enemies only; after they and their customers are infected with the virus, 

not even Aesculapius himself, the mighty Greek God of Healing will be able 

to cure them and they will die under the shadow of a new breed of 

biological computer warfare.



	To successfully complete this essay, you will need: wdsm89, SoftICE 

3.X, any hex editor. The program is located at www.idmcomp.com, named 

uedit32.exe and is less than 1MB long.





	This scheme is not as strong as I thought it would be, given the 

fact that UltraEdit's author changes the algorithm with every new version. 

UltraEdit has become a standard for us to write our cracking essays, so it 

should be worthy to unveil the scheme behind it. UltraEdit author learned a 

lot since <A href="ueditcrk.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ueditcrk.htm">+Rezident and I</A> cracked his baby. In this new version, Windows 

API's use is kept at minimum to avoid possible intrusion via SoftICE 

breakpointing on them. Even the string lengths are calculated trough a 

rather old fashion custom mathematical procedure to avoid the use of any 

API; however, the program still has to read the registration file to 

gather its initiation values, so a bpx on readfile should be enough to find 

a fairly close entry point to it.



	Once we're in, you'll eventually find this:





:0045BE35 56                      push esi 

:0045BE36 8BF1                    mov esi, ecx 

:0045BE38 E8C8FAFFFF              call 0045B905 ; Copy your name to 

						  memory location :0094229C

:0045BE3D 8B06                    mov eax, dword ptr [esi] ; Your name 

						             location 

							     offset in EAX

:0045BE3F 8B542408                mov edx, dword ptr [esp+08] ; 02H in EDX

:0045BE43 8A4C240C                mov cl, byte ptr [esp+0C] ; 09H in CL

:0045BE47 5E                      pop esi 

:0045BE48 880C10                  mov byte ptr [eax+edx], cl ; Move byte 

							       09H to 

							       substitute 

							       the third 

							       letter of

							       your name

:0045BE4B C20800                  ret 0008 ; return





	This piece of code prepares the address offset, where EAX points to 

your name, EDX is 02H so EAX+EDX points to the third character in your 

name, finally CL which is equal to 09H is copied over the third character 

of your name. In my case, Aesculapius, the first 's' letter is substituted 

with 09H.



:00426813 E81D560300              call 0045BE35 ; Return from the previous

						  code	

:00426818 A1E0014A00              mov eax, dword ptr [004A01E0]; Memory

								 offset of

								 your name 

:0042681D 8D4D0C                  lea ecx, dword ptr [ebp+0C]    

:00426820 8A4005                  mov al, byte ptr [eax+05]      Load fifth

								 character

								 of your

								 name in AL

:00426823 0C55                    or al, 55 			 Inclusive 

								 OR of that 

								 character 

:00426825 50                      push eax 

:00426826 6A05                    push 00000005 

:00426828 E808560300              call 0045BE35 ; We'll continue here



	As you can see, there are two copies of your name at :004A01E0 and 

:0094229C. The last location contains a copy from first one. The copy 

procedure is a very funny dynamic addressing process located somewhat 

before. As you can see, the original offset memory location of your name at 

:004A01E0 is stored in EAX, then at :00426820 the fifth character of your 

name is loaded in AL and then, the code executes an 'Inclusive or' with it. 

Now lets trace inside call at :004268B8;





:0045BE35 56                      push esi 

:0045BE36 8BF1                    mov esi, ecx 

:0045BE38 E8C8FAFFFF              call 0045B905               ; Checks some characters

						              ; in your name

:0045BE3D 8B06                    mov eax, dword ptr [esi]    ; Points to your name

:0045BE3F 8B542408                mov edx, dword ptr [esp+08] ; 05H in EDX

:0045BE43 8A4C240C                mov cl, byte ptr [esp+0C]   ; Inclusive 

								OR result

								(see 

								previous

								snippet)

								on CL

:0045BE47 5E                      pop esi 

:0045BE48 880C10                  mov byte ptr [eax+edx], cl ; Substitute

							       fifth 

							       character in

							       your name

							       with the

							       Inclusive OR

							       result

:0045BE4B C20800                  ret 0008





	The Inclusive OR calculation of the fifth character in your name is 

stored, then it substitutes the real fifth character in your name.

	Until now this is the result of the previous code: The third 

character in your name has been substituted with byte 09H and the fifth 

character after an Inclusive OR with byte 55H is copied back to its place.





	All these mathematical games could be there to ease the task of 

changing the algorithm very often, as in fact happens with this 

application. 





:0040B645 6A3C                    push 0000003C; push 60 bytes in stack

	Well, what happens now: the memory location where the final valid 

code will be calculated is filled with 60 bytes containing Hexadecimal 

value 2EH which is a dot '.' in decimal. Why? How the hell would I know? 

I'm a cracker not a magician! However I think this could be some sort of 

future expansion configuration. We later see that the valid code is only 

16 characters long (10H) but the code memory location is prepared with 60 

characters (3CH) instead. Probably the programmer thought to leave some 

additional space, so it is possible that in the future, Ultraedit valid 

code will be 18 or even 20 characters long, who knows.

	This is very simple. All Hex values of every character in your 

modified name (the name with the 09H in the third position and the 

Inclusive OR of the fifth character in fifth position) are added and the 

result is stored in AL. This is a checksum procedure.

	This piece of code follows two possible paths; from character 1 to 

8 of the valid code, all result characters are letters and from 9 

to 16, all characters are numbers. There are two XORing processes, the 

first between a magic number and the Complement NOT of the checksum from 

your modified name and the second one between the result from the first and 

one byte of your modified name. Finally the two paths will assure that the 

first eight characters of the valid code are letters and the last ones 

numbers.

On very important fact is that the result from all the calculations is 

directly stored in the valid code memory location. Unfortunately, as you 

will notice, the first eight letters of the code are unprintable ASCII 

characters, so the author created a second valid code, which is stored in 

the next lines:





:0040B6CB 88943540FFFFFF          mov byte ptr [ebp+esi-000000C0], dl

				  ; Store second valid code in ebp+esi-C0

:0040B6D2 46                      inc esi; Increase counter

:0040B6D3 83FE3C                  cmp esi, 0000003C ; Process 60 bytes

:0040B6D6 7CA8                    jl 0040B680 ; repeat cycle



	Now the following code fixes the final validation code:   



:0040B6D8 33DB                    xor ebx, ebx

:0040B6DA 33D2                    xor edx, edx

As the first 8 characters of the first valid code are filled with loads of 

unreadable characters, the following lines substitute bytes: 22H, 27H, 2EH, 

60H AND 7CH with 23H, 28H, 2FH, 61H and 6CH. It also carries out some 

additional corrections to every single byte in the code.



	Well, as Samuel Morse said: <FONT color="blue">What has God brought!</FONT>



	There are two valid codes; the first one is partially calculated 

and stored in [EBP-40]; then a second valid code derivates from the first 

and is stored in [EBP-C0]; the code you typed is stored in [ebp-80];

finally, the first valid code is corrected to substitute the unreadable 

ASCII characters. As the second code is not corrected and perfectly 

readable in the first place, we will use it in the S/N Generator along with 

the partially calculated first code. The final first valid code wont be 

calculated in this essay, bacause although is easy to do it, since we 

clearly understood all the process, it is not neccessary to do it. 

Remember, always do what you got to do, nothing more, nothing less (who 

said this?).



	The S/N generator is finally coded:</PRE><XMP>

	In the S/N generator, 60 bytes of code are also calculated, even 

when only 16 bytes are used; off course, I'm thinking in the future too,
