                        Cracking OpenNT 2.0

                        ===================

                        ==== by chown =====





target :        OpenNT 2.0, by Softway Systems

link :          http://www.softway.com

protection :    generic serial numbers

method :        brute force

tools :         SoftICE NT, disassembler, C++ compiler (Win32)

needed :        average cracking skills, knowledge of C/C++



About

-----

If like Unix and you haven't got Linux, then OpenNT is probably the 

next-best thing. 

Unlike most Unix-like environments available today, this one doesn't 

emulate the programs; instead they run on their own POSIX subsystem 

(POSIX is an interface just like Win32 or OS/2).  

Besides this enhanced subsystem, you'll get bunch of Unix 

utilities, the KornShell &amp; C shell, Perl, sed, awk ...; support for 

sockets, memory mapped files, hard links...; an SDK, X11R6 windowing, 

Motif window manager, etc...

All these little wonders, nicely packed on a CD-ROM, shipped to your 

font door for free...

You're probably thinking : sounds too good to be true, and you're right. 

-&gt; when you receive the CD-ROM, you get 2 keys which will only 

   unlock some components of OpenNT; and to make things even worse, those 

   components have &quot;best before dates&quot; (also known as 'drop dead dates' i.e. 

   they stop working on a fixed date, no matter when you start using them)

-&gt; the other components can only be bought (you'll then get &quot;everlasting&quot; 

   keys) 

 

To sum things up, here's the whole list of available components : 

   OpenNT Workstation Lite  (pay for key)

   OpenNT Workstation       (best before date OR pay for &quot;everlasting&quot; key)

   OpenNT Server            (pay for key)

   OpenNT X11R6 Server      (best before date OR pay for &quot;everlasting&quot; key)

   OpenNT SDK               (best before date OR pay for &quot;everlasting&quot; key)

   OpenNT OpenNTiF          (pay for key)

   OpenNT OpenNTiF SDK      (pay for key)



(Note : when reading the essay, don't forget that the &quot;Lite&quot; version of 

the Workstation is NOT the version you can install with the best before 

key !! You need to pay for the Lite version!)



So let's get started!   

<HR>

When you run the installation, the second screen prompts you for the 

serial numbers. 

As a cracker, you would normally have 2 options: 

(a) you fill in the keys you received, and later you simply disable the 

best before dates; the problem here is that you'll eventually have to 

rerun and crack the setup program if you want to install the other 

components. 

(b) you immediately crack the setup program in order to install whatever 

component you want; the problem with this option is that after you've 

cracked the installation, you'll need to crack the installed programs, 

because they too will look for the &quot;everlasting&quot; keys (in the registry). 

None of these 2 options are very difficult, in fact I'm sure most of you 

could easily crack it either way.  The purpose of this essay however, 

is to show you yet another approach. 



Let's start by sniffing around a little to see what the setup program 

(InstallShield) is really up to. You'll quickly find out that it has 

created a directory (called &quot;_ISTMP0.DIR&quot;) in your TEMP directory.  

So what's in _ISTMP0.DIR 

? 

   9/16/94  14:00          25,088  CTL3D32.DLL

   9/16/94  14:00          26,112  CTL3D32S.DLL

   5/08/97   3:31          19,456  e3e9c.DLL

   1/22/96  20:59          90,112  e3e92.DLL

   5/05/97  16:03           5,776  LICENSE.TXT

   5/08/97   3:31          46,080  MYDLL.dll

   2/28/97  21:11          20,784  opennt.bmp

   4/11/97   9:24          75,466  setup.bmp

   5/21/97  12:05          88,574  _SETUP.LIB



Let's see... CTL3*.DLL are the 3D-controls the setup program needs, 

LICENSE.TXT is the license info nobody ever reads, *.bmp are bitmaps, 

and _SETUP.LIB is a compressed file (see note [1]) that contains the 

other 8 files in this directory. 

So this leaves us with the 3 DLLs; two of them have pseudo-random 

names (every installation will name these files differently), the 

other DLL has a strange name. 

     [1] you could check this if you have a nice little program called 

&quot;compress&quot; (which is from the company that makes InstallShield); you can 

use this program to unpack all compressed file of InstallShield.

So let's start with MYDLL.DLL (the programmer who wrote this library 

must have been a hell of a creative guy, and quite possessive too!). 

Time for some disassembly... 

(Note : you'll have to copy these files to another directory BEFORE you 

quit setup, because they will get deleted upon exit.)



After WDasm has done its job, we first check the string references for 

anything suspicious. We find strings like &quot;sdk&quot;, &quot;sdk_demo&quot;, &quot;xs&quot;, 

&quot;xs_demo&quot;.... hmmm, interesting, but since we're dealing with a DLL, 

let's take a look at the exports... 

... Bingo!! Look at names of some of these exported functions : 

        isDemoKey

        whatIsThis

        verifyKey

Now, how many times does Fravia+ and all other +HCUkers have to repeat 

themselves ?!!! 

When will the programmers finally get the message? These names are like 

a path of oasis inside a desert, they are like flashing neon lights in 

the dark alleys of disassembly. 

So, once more for the record 

-&gt; ATTENTION TO ALL PROTECTIONISTS: DON'T CLUTTER YOUR PROGRAMS WITH 

TELLTALE NAMES ! 



Back to MYDLL.DLL. Let's check each of these suspicious functions : 



_____________________________isDemoKey____________________________





Exported fn(): isDemoKey - Ord:000Ah

//...

:100031D4   test eax, eax

:100031D6   je 100031E8

:100031DC   xor eax, eax

:100031DE   jmp 100031F2

:100031E3   jmp 100031F2

:100031E8   mov eax, 00000001

:100031ED   jmp 100031F2

:100031F2   pop edi

:100031F3   pop esi

:100031F4   pop ebx

:100031F5   leave

:100031F6   ret 0004



I've left most of the code out because it really doesn't matter how 

&quot;isDemoKey&quot; is implemented. The only thing we're interested in, 

is its interface (don't forget that these are *exported* functions 

- try to think of this as object oriented cracking :-). 

So these few lines of assembly tell us enough: isDemoKey either 

returns 0 or 1 in EAX. 

(1 in EAX most likely means the key is a 'drop dead' key, 0 means 

you paid for the key; we'll check this later in SoftICE)

:100032B9 C20400                  ret 0004



Again, most of the code is left out. We see that &quot;whatIsThis&quot; returns 

one of the following in EAX : 12D, 12E, 12F, 131, 132, 133, 130 or 0. 

What do these numbers stand for, you ask?? Patience, first verifyKey... 



--------------------------intermezzo-------------------------------

Quoting Larry Wall (father of the Perl language) :

&quot;the three great virtues of a programmer: laziness, impatience, and 

hubris.&quot; Well, these three &quot;virtues&quot; are, in fortiori, applicable to 

crackers (IMO). 

But think about it: the latter is a consequence of the former, because 

IF the protectionists were to put more work protecting their software, 

we would HAVE TO do the same for our cracks! 

But that ... is a BIG, VERY BIG IF.

The only way out of this vicious circle is to crack ALL programs to 

pieces, in order to force the protectionist to take more care &amp; pride 

in their work.



The Perl language, by the way, is included on this CDROM and is a very 

nice &amp; practical language indeed. The quote is from Larry Wall's very 

funny &amp; good book &quot;Programming Perl&quot;. There used to be a complete online 

version of the book available 

at <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://online-books.oreilly.com/books/webref/perl/index.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://online-books.oreilly.com/books/webref/perl/index.htm'" tppabs="http://online-books.oreilly.com/books/webref/perl/index.htm">http://online-books.oreilly.com/books/webref/perl/index.htm</A>, 

maybe it's still there...

____________________________verifyKey_____________________________



Exported fn(): verifyKey - Ord:0009h

:10002360 C20400                  ret 0004



Conclusion : verifyKey return its result in eax.



__________________________________________________________________________________



Now, to be sure these functions really do what we hope they do, we 

need SoftICE. 

But before we do that we need to get a feel of out target, so we 

start setup.exe, we then fill in some bogus keys to see what happens... 

Well, we get a little messagebox saying that the keys are invalid. 

Now we fill in the 'drop dead' keys we received with the package, 

press &quot;next&quot; and... we simply get the next screen. 

OK, now press 'back' or 'cancel' to return to the first screen.

Fire up SoftICE and let the SoftICE Symbol Loader load the exports of 

MYDLL.DLL.  

We then set execution breakpoints on each of these functions 

(BPX verifyKey; 

 BPX whatIsThis; 

 BPX isDemoKey). 

Again, we enter the 2 keys we received from Softway. Press the &quot;OK&quot; 

button... SoftICE immediately pops up at verifyKey. 

All we need to know about verifyKey, is what kind of result it returns 

in EAX; so we simply enter &quot;G @SS:ESP&quot; in SoftICE (or press F11) to 

return to the calling function, and we see there that EAX = 0. 

We press F5 to continue... SoftICE pops up at whatIsThis, press 

F11 to return... EAX = 12E. 

We take note and continue with F5. 

It's now isDemoKey's turn to pop up, again F11... EAX = 1... F5...

Now SoftICE pops at verifyKey for the second time. Well, this is 

MYDLL.DLL checking the second key. The second time around we have :

     verifyKey   -&gt; EAX = 0

     whatIsThis  -&gt; EAX = 131

     isDemoKey   -&gt; EAX = 1

We could already try to draw some conclusions here, but let's try the 

same routine with some *bogus* keys. If you would do this, you'd get 

twice (for 2 keys) :

     verifyKey   -&gt; EAX = 1

     whatIsThis  -&gt; EAX = 0

     isDemoKey   -&gt; doesn't get called

You should be getting the picture by now : 

     verifyKey   -&gt; returns 0 if the key was valid, 1 if invalid

     whatIsThis  -&gt; returns 0 if invalid key, another value 

                    (see note [2]) if valid

     isDemoKey   -&gt; returns 1 if the key was a demo key, 0 if key 

                    was paid for



    [2] for the &quot;other&quot; value we have so far :

        12E -&gt; iff the valid key was for the Workstation option

        131 -&gt; iff the valid key was for the SDK option

    

Let's try the other return values to see what they mean. This is a 

typical and VERY important reversing approach. 

Therefore we need to enter some bogus key, and upon return from 

verifyKey, we change the value in EAX from 1 to 0. We change the

 return value of whatIsThis from 0 to (12D | 12F | 130 | 132 | 133), 

and we also make sure isDemoKey returns 0 (=full version).

Doing this, the setup program will reveal which versions match which 

keys. 

Don't forget that, using this method, you COULD trick the setup program 

to install whatever version you want, BUT (a) this is not the point 

of the essay, and 

(b) you'll need to crack the program a 2nd time after installation 

(and the 2nd crack is not as trivial as this one).



So, after having tried all combination we get the following list :

    12D = Workstation Lite

    12E = Workstation

    12F = Server

    130 = Bad key

    131 = X11R6 Server

    132 = SDK



Up to now everything we've done has been pretty elementary, but did you 

know that that was the hardest part of this crack? We are now simply going 

to use these three functions to generate valid serial numbers for us!!

How ? Well, since the functions are exported, we'll just write a program 

that *imports* these functions. We will repeatedly call the three functions 

and test their results until we have correct keys!



Here's the idea in pseudo-code :



    WHILE (we haven't found enough keys yet) DO

        generate a key to test (see note [3])

        test key in verifyKey

        test key in whatIsThis

        test key in isDemo

        IF (the key is good) THEN

            print the key

			print what kind of key it is

        ELSE

            simply try another key

        END

    END	

		

    [3] We are going to loop over all possible keys that	

        have the same form as the keys we received from Softway. 

        The keys you'll receive will look something like &quot;fSu,0qw?eSK&quot;, 

        so this means all keys of length 11 (eleven) that are a 

        combination of all possible letters, all possible digits, 

        and all possible punctuation symbols will be tried).

        In the code of my program, however, you'll see that I only 

        try combinations in the following subset 



&quot;ABCDEFGH=JKLMN*PQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijk?mnopqrstuvwxyz()23456789+/&quot; , 



        this is because I had a quick look at what the program 

        compares the input key to. But even if hadn't done that, the 

        program would still find the good keys, it would only take a 

        little longer.

	    

First a note : I'm a real newbie at Windows programming, in fact the 

following code is the second Windows program I've ever made (the first 

one, 2 weeks ago, was a program that simply displayed a message box :-), 

so bear with me if I've made some stupid mistake(s). 

But it does compile and work!



For those of you who know even less of Windows programming than I do :

I chose to dynamically load the DLL, which you should do like this (I 

think)

    -&gt; define a global handle : HMODULE hlib

    -&gt; load MYDLL.DLL like : HMODULE LoadLibrary(&quot;MYDLL.DLL&quot;)

    -&gt; declare the imported function

    -&gt; get a pointer to the function like: 

       FARPROC GetProcAddress(hlib,&quot;verifyKey&quot;);

    -&gt; call the function

    -&gt; free the DLL like : FreeLibrary()

	

Now, how on earth are we going to declare a function if we don't really 

know its signature (all we do know is that it returns &quot;something&quot; in EAX)?

Well, you simply call it with whatever parameters you chose, and then 

when you try to compile it, the compiler will do the rest for us by 

flagging an error AND giving the real signature of the function.

For instance, when I declared the function verifyKey with :

    int verifyKey(char*);

the compiler told me that it really should be :

    void cdecl (*verifyKey)(void*, long);



That told me all I needed, except that I had no clue whatsoever what the 

hell &quot;cdecl&quot; meant! So I looked it up, and found out that it's some special 

calling convention where the function the *caller* of a function cleans 

up the stack....

I didn't really figure out what that all meant for me, so I tried a few 

things (using SoftICE as a true debugger, finally!! :-), and ended up 

with a solution only a cracker could have come up with : inline assembly 

to get the stack pointer to point to what it should be pointing to!



Anyway, here's the code : </PRE>

The program starts the loop with the key &quot;AAAAAAAAAAA&quot;, then it checks 

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAB&quot;, 

and so on...

The output will be of the form :

    AJKDS9)fdoe  -&gt;  Server

    lkjsdfhuyee  -&gt;  WorkStation

    67e4dsfew78  -&gt;  SDK

   ....

(these keys are false of course!!)





The OpenNTif component of OpenNT isn't covered here because it's a 

different installation all together. I've cracked that the 

&quot;conventional&quot; way myself, but I'm not going to bother you with that, 

because you could probably crack it blindfolded! ( -&gt; a simple 

&quot;jmp goodguy / jmp badguy&quot; inside the file &quot;PINSTALL&quot;, and once 

it's installed, there are no further checks) 

-&gt; you see, I even left you a piece of the cake ;-)





That's all for now,

ADDENDUM

--------

I've just checked everything again, and it seems that the executables 

created by VC++ 5 and BC++ 5 work differently !

The executable created by BC++ 5 doesn't find as many valid keys as the 

one compiled by VC++; it just seems to skip many valid keys!

It doesn't really matter, because they both generate enough valid keys 

anyway, but I just thought I'd let you know...

Another point to remember is that with &quot;default configuration&quot; I meant 

that VC++ MUST compile the code *with debug* information (which is the 

default setting if I'm not mistaken). If you compile it without, the 

executable will crash (on my machine anyway). 

The executable of BC++ will run with or without debug info.
