<HR>SLH's seventh paper<BR>The sting</FONT><HR>

</CENTER>

"<FONT color=purple> Whereas most languages have changed in almost unintelligible ways over a

 long period, the assembler of 15 years ago which you can still find on the

 net looks very much the same as the current 32 bit assembler. In terms of

 time scale, this is like digging up an ancient acheological site and finding

 an inscription on the wall that you can read.

<P>

 The main difference is that 32 bit assembler is not cursed with the problems

 and restrictions of segment arithmetic and is both much clearer and far more

 powerful.</FONT>"

<I>SLH is back again with the last (the seventh) of his small masterpieces: You would be well advised to read 

all the preceding parts of what is going to be a DEFINITIVE HCU MANUAL INTRODUCING  

WINDOWS DISASSEMBLING: it's a concentrated <U>very good</U> 

course about the UTMOST IMPORTANCE of assembling 

in everyday windows (or whatever) programming. This will help you, among other 

things :-) in order to 

better understand 

the purposes (and the power) of what we are all doing here...<BR><BR>

> Applying The Sting

>

> For the modern software warrior who has done their penance and paid homage

> to the great god of visual garbage, its time to put aside the trivia of

> endless interface graphics and wield the weapon of war in the way it was

> intended. A minimum size, fast and efficient template, the mastery of

> resources and controls and the easy manipulation of the interface in terms

> of its appearance is a formula that is without peer in the world of software

> design.

>

> With some variation between compilers, this package should compile at around

> 20k depending on how much space is taken up in the resources which is one

> hell of a lot better than 200k or worse that you get from the RAD vendors.

>

> How you proceed with it depends on what type of application you have in

> mind. If you are writing small specialised applications, then you will

> probably add different modules which group related functions together so

> that the project is well laid out and easy enough to extend and maintain.

>

> If however, the application you have in mind is going to be a multi-megabyte

> monster, then you have to think about what is the most efficient way to

> write it. You could in fact write it the same way as a small specialised

> application but even if it is well written, fast and compact code, the load

> time and the memory demand will tend to make it sluggish, particularly if

> the machine it is run on does not have large resources available.

>

> One of the few good things that came out of the early versions of windows

> was dynamic link libraries. When you consider that the early versions of

> windows would run on a 286 with one meg of ram, albeit, only just, you

> understand where the need came from to be efficient in the use of system

> resource.

>

> Dynamic link libraries solved one of the problems that was left over from

> DOS application programming, how to get capacity in excess of the available

> memory limitations. The idea of having a separate file that carried a

> collection of useful functions that could be called on demand meant that

> you could have a relatively small executable file that called what it needed

> and unloaded it when it was finished.

>

> In a modern 32 bit application, this equation is still in the leading edge

> of design in that whatever the viable size may be for either the operating

> system or the specific hardware that it is being run under, you can deliver

> more capacity than the immediate size will allow by writing the core of

> your application as a fast minimum size executable and farming out the

> occasional functions or objects to a DLL which is loaded on demand and

> unloaded when finished.

>

> This extends your application's size and capacity to nearly the size of

> available disk space if that is what you need to write. It also allows you

> to write miniature rockets that do the same thing so that they minimise

> resource demand while delivering extended capacity.

>

> What follows is a bare skeleton of the DLLMain function in C. There is a

> reasonably broad range of C compilers that will do this job well but you

> will need to chase up the specifics of each compiler to ensure that you get

> it right. The nod is that not only are the M$ and Borland C compilers up to

> scratch to do the job but the Zortech and Symantec C compilers are also very

> grunty in the area of EXE and DLL creation.

>

> For the warrior who likes their code written with the flavour of bubble gum,

> the PowerBasic DLL compiler is an industry standard specialist DLL compiler

> that gives nothing away in terms of performance so you are not at any

> disadvantage at all to warriors of other languages.

> The DllMain function is like the WinMain function in that you don't call it,

> the one that you will process when you are starting or terminating processes

> within your DLL.

>

> It is the processing of the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH constant that determines

> whether the DLL loads or not. If your nominated processing returns "TRUE",

> then the DLL loads, if it returns "FALSE" the DLL unloads. The other three

> return values are ignored.

>

> The DLL_PROCESS_DETACH constant is where you perform any actions that you

> want to happen as the DLL unloads. This can be deleting resources, closing

> windows or any other process you like.

>

> One of the tricks when designing a DLL is to put an ordinary system dialog

> box in each one of the four constants that can be processed as it gives you

>     DLLEXPORT BOOL WINAPI MyDLLFunc(HWND hWnd, LPSTR lpszText)

>       {

>         Write your function code here

>       }

>

> With basic, you must do a little more work to ensure that the function name

> that occurs in the export list of the compiled DLL is in the form that you

> want. You use ALIAS to do this.

>

> FUNCTION MyDLLFunc ALIAS "MyDLLFunc"(ByVal hWnd as LONG,_

>                                      lpszText as ASCIIZ) EXPORT as LONG

>     Write your function code here

>     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> END FUNCTION

>

> In the application, if you want the DLL at startup, you declare it in your

> header file as follows,

>

> DECLARE FUNCTION MyDLLFunc LIB "MYDLL.DLL" ALIAS "MyDLLFunc"_

>                         (ByVal hWnd as LONG,lpszText as ASCIIZ) as LONG

>

> In C, you put the following into your header file ensuring that the data

> types match your function call.

>

>     DLLIMPORT BOOL WINAPI MyDLLFunc (HWND, LPSTR);

>

> To check the exports in your compiled DLL, you use dumppe.exe to make sure

> that your function name has compiled the way you want it because if you get

> the case wrong, your app will not be able to find it when it is called.

>

> There are basically two way that you load a DLL, either at startup as is

> done in Visual Basic or by using the LoadLibrary function. In terms of

> performance, there is little advantage in loading a DLL at startup as it

> increases the load time of the calling app to that of simply writing the

> code in the DLL into the app directly.

>

> The only reason why you bother if you have the option to do both is to use

> a common block of code between a number of different applications that you

> may wish to run at the same time.

>

> Using the LoadLibrary() function and the corresponding FreeLibrary()

> function gives you the capacity to only use the resources occupied by the

> DLL when you need its functions in the calling application.

>

> Encapsulated Applets

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> One of the smart things you can do with dynamic link libraries is write

> complete working applets within them so that you can call a complete

> "object" from you application. If for example, you write accountancy

> software, you may want a specialised calculator that not only does the

> normal number crunching but other profession specific functions.

>

> One of the trick ways of writing a DLL of this type is to write it as an

> EXE first because they are far easier to debug in that form. There are a

> couple of tricks involved in doing this as you need to be able to pass the

> applications "hInstance" and "hWnd" to it so you write the WinMain function

> with an eye to modifying it later.

>

> When you have the applet up and running as an executable file, you convert

> it to a DLL by first writing a DllMain or LibMain function as we have seen

> above, Then you modify the WinMain function in it so that it is a function

> call that is exported.

>

> FUNCTION SmartCalc ALIAS "SmartCalc"(ByVal Instance as LONG, _

>                                      ByVal hParent  as LONG,) _

>                                      EXPORT as LONG

>

> Both Instance and hParent must be declared in the header file for the DLL

> so that they can be "seen" all over the DLL. You "assign" the passed

> Instance parameter to hInstance,

>

>     hInstance = Instance

>

>   and your applet then uses the instance handle of the calling application.

>

> If the applet has a simple interface that does not call any dialog boxes,

> you may not need to use the hParent parameter but if you call any system

> dialog boxes you need to use the hParent rather than the applet's "hWnd"

> to avoid an unusual problem.

>

> The dialog boxes will run OK from the applet's hWnd but if you close the

> application without closing the applet first, it will GP fault on exit

> because the DLL applet no longer has a valid instance handle. You solve

> the trash on exit by closing down the applet with a,

>  called from the DLL_PROCESS_DETACH part of the DllMain or LibMain function

> but it will still GP fault on exit if you have a system dialog box displayed

> when the calling application is closed down. You solve this second problem

> by using the passed hParent for the dialog boxes instead of the applet's

>

> The win from re-writing the executable as an applet in a DLL is that you

>         Byte  DB = 00 ------------ hex

>         Word  DW = 00 00 --------- hex

>         Dword DD = 00 00 00 00 --- hex

> The Data Manipulation Instructions

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> We start exploring the built in capacity in the processor to move data

> around at high speed with a deviation of the [ movs ] instruction, "movsb",

> move string in byte size chunks.

>

> This instruction has to be set up and used in conjunction with other

> instructions to perform its function of copying bytes from one location in

> memory to another. It uses the architecture of placing a number of the

> correct data size in the ecx register, it then loads a pointer to the Source

> block of memory into the source index [ esi ], loads a pointer to the

> destination block of memory into the destination index [ edi ] and finally

> it requires the use of a conditional repeat instruction [ repnz ].

>

>     mov ecx, numBytes        ; number of bytes to copy

>     mov esi, adrSource       ; pointer to source

>     mov edi, adrDestination  ; pointer to destination

>     repnz movsb              ; repeat byte copy while ecx not = zero.

>

> This combination decrements ecx for each byte copied until it is zero where

> it then exits the loop. You then have the contents of the Source copied into

> the Destination. To set this up in a working function, you must allocate

> two blocks of memory, one which has the source data in it and the second

> which is either the same size in bytes or larger. If it is not at least the

> same size, you will get a page fault from overwriting memory that your app

> does not own.

>

> In the following function, you pass a pointer to both blocks of memory and a

> long integer for the length. To re-write this function in C inline asm, you

> will need to pay attention to the passing of parameters to ensure that you

> are passing pointers to both source and destination. In basic, you use

> either the VarPtr() function or the StrPtr() function if your data is

> dynamic string.

>     2. [ stos ] "Store String" with variations stosb, stosw, stosd

>

> They work in much the same way as the previous mnemonics, you use ecx as

> They both use the accumulator register [ al/ah, ax, eax ] in the appropriate

> data size to access the data from the source index and write it to the

> destination index, this is how it is accessible for processing by the

> programmer. [ lodsd ] reads a DWORD size piece of data from the source

> Intel mnemonic cracking

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> There is a technique for cracking Intel mnemonics that would not be widely

> known if you didn't have at least a couple of bottles of malt handy. You

> also need an object heavy enough to hold the left button of the mouse down.

> An old Pentax camera does the job fine.

>

> Armed with this "cracking" kit, you can undertake Intel mnemonic cracking

> by following the instructions, Load any one of the three Intel PDF files

> into Acrobat Reader, start dragging downwards with the mouse. As it starts

> to scroll downwards, sit the base of the camera on the left button of the

> mouse and prop up the camera so that it does not move with the two bottles

> of malt.

>

> Once this is going, you can sit back and watch it until it reaches the end

> of the file which takes just about forever but at least you are not cramping

> your hand holding the button down. When it eventually gets to the end which

> seems like eternity, copy it to the clipboard and save it into a text file.

>

> About the only thing that can go wrong with this "cracking" technique is if

> you forget while you are watching it scroll away and reach for one of the

> bottles of malt. This will almost exclusively result in the camera slipping

> off the mouse button and you have to start again.

>

> With some judicious use of the search and replace function in a good, BIG

> text editor, you can get this mess into reasonably readable form without

> having to use that absolutely disgusting Adobe PDF format Acrobat Reader.

>

> Perform this "crack" on the other two Intel files and you have a programming

> manual that will not go out of date quickly. This is a point not to be lost

> after having shovelled through other language manuals over time.

>

> Whereas most languages have changed in almost unintelligible ways over a

> long period, the assembler of 15 years ago which you can still find on the

> net looks very much the same as the current 32 bit assembler. In terms of

> time scale, this is like digging up an ancient acheological site and finding

> an inscription on the wall that you can read.

>

> The main difference is that 32 bit assembler is not cursed with the problems

> and restrictions of segment arithmetic and is both much clearer and far more

> powerful.

>

> Back Through The Warp

> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> For this ancient warrior, the warp is starting to waiver and I must return

> for a while to do those things that ancient warriors do, rescue the odd

> damsel in distress, lay siege to a castle or two, wind up the ancient chariot

> to go where many have gone before and yes, write some more code.

>

> In your hands is Excalibur, how you wield it will shape the world of

> computing to come and in only a short time in real world terms, you will

> yourselves become one of the ancient warriors.

>

> In recovering these near lost arts, you have re-established the connection

> between the past and the future which had almost been lost in the present.

> The tools of the future are built in the present from the knowledge of the

> past.

>

> Wield your Excalibur well as the ancient warriors often roam the corridors

> of the Internet in search of clever things and their eye will not miss the

> work of another warrior who has maintained their professional skill and

> integrity by refusing to sell out to the wide and easy path that leads to

> oblivion.
