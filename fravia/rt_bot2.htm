Perl is a good language to learn - fairly
straightforward, quick, very powerful and ideal
for bots, cgi and the net generally! I hope that
+fravia will publish this as part of the
botstart section and that the bot section will start
boting. </center> <br><br>

<p>
What can I say about Perl? It's a good language to
learn. Virtually all cgi is done in
Perl but it's good for virtually anything that you'd
care to do and it's possible to
develop applications very quickly. I'm not yet that
experienced at Perl - this is my first
'real' app and I'm certain that this bot is not
written at all well, but it is
written. Perhaps that's the best thing about Perl - it
enables you to do things that would
not otherwise be possible. The CPAN Perl code
repository on the net holds vast quantities
of free code to do almost anything you could ever wish
- but you have to be able to use
Perl. You will need to download at least the LWP (it
stands for libwwwperl) module from
CPAN for this or almost any Perl bot to work.
<p>
There are
many Perl bots available on the
net, but I'm fairly certain that you will not find one
that does exactly what you want.
There's also a convention amoung bot writers not to
give bots to people who do not
understand them - it's considered irresponsible. Of
course, once you've learned how to
build bots, you can be as irresponsible as you like.
What all this means is that you have
to learn to appreciate them and Perl or you don't
deserve them. Don't worry, it's easy
enough - just a little effort.
<p>
Please note that this is not good Perl code and I am
not a programmer.
This bot shows that to start using Perl you only need
to understand
a little. The accepted approach for newbies writing
Perl5
applications is to get them working first, then
improve on them if
necessary.
<p>
Here's a very simple web retrieval bot I've written
that
retrieves many web pages from a single
site. This bot is fairly limited in what it can
achieve, (and bots can do far more than download web
pages) but you are free to add any
functionality you like - just write the code.
</i>
</pre>
<p>
The hcuBOT/0.2 is written as a Linux application -
it will need work to use on windoze (I recommend
installing Linux;).
ActivePerl (1.5 meg) needs to be downloaded to use
Perl under
windoze.
<p> Perl helps development all the way with excellent
error messages. You can write it cryptically or you
can write it
simply. I'm going to write it simply until I learn
more - I hope that
this code is fairly clear. Use 'use diagnostics' and
the -w switch
only while developing - they can cause strange
messages to be sent to
servers. If something doesn't work, try it a slightly
different way. I
tend to use print statements to identify where perl
fails and this
seems to work well but there's also a very good
debugger built in.
<p>
There are notes after the source to explain what's
happening.

The bot replaces a browser, sending requests for web

<p>
identifies the bot as hcuBOT/0.2, while the
jclinton... is the email address
the server administrator should contact if your bot
screws up her server -
she'll send you an awfully polite email. So to pretend
to be a particular
browser, you would replace hcuBOT/0.2 with something
like &quot;Mozilla/3.1&quot;.
You'll have to check the actual string that the
browser sends.
<p>
hcuBOT/0.2 sends a GET command to the server. It says
that it wants particular web pages by
saying GET this url with the url of the document that
you're after. There are other
commands - MIRROR, HEAD, POST and a few others.
Mirror compares the document on the server with your
local document. If the server's
document is newer, that document is retrieved. Mirror
works by sending a
request with an if-modified-since (date/time of your
document) header.
<p>
Let's take a look at some headers that hcuBOT/0.2
works with.
<pre>

<p>
Quite a whopper that response header, they're not
normally that big. The request is simple
on this one, it's <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=jclinton@whitehouse.gov&YY=49912&order=down&sort=date&pos=0  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=jclinton@whitehouse.gov&YY=49912&order=down&sort=date&pos=0'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=jclinton@whitehouse.gov&YY=49912&order=down&sort=date&pos=0">jclinton@whitehouse.gov</a> saying GET
<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.oracle.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.oracle.com/'" tppabs="http://www.oracle.com/" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/</a> using
User-Agent: hcuBOT/0.2.
<p>
The important part of the response is the first line
<font color="red">&quot;HTTP/1.1 200
OK&quot;</font>. <p>
Hypertext TransferProtocol (HTTP) will either be 1.1
or 1.0. Version 0.9 only supports
the GET method and is not used now as far as I'm
aware. 1.0 supports GET, HEAD, POST,
PUT, DELETE, LINK and UNLINK. 1.1 supports a few extra
methods. This header says that it
will accept HEAD and GET requests.
<p>
An important part is the response code. We want
response code 200
as shown here which is the server replying &quot;OK, here's
the document you asked for&quot;.
Response codes 100 to 199 are not implemented. 200 is
what we want. 200-299 are request
successfull, but that doesn't really mean that you'll
get the document. 300-399 are
redirection which can cause a bit of trouble. 400 is
bad request (syntax error in the
request header), 404 is document not found - just like
when you click on a stale link. 400
- 499 you don't want. Server Errors are the 500 range
which you don't want. 500 is
internal server error, one that you don't want but
will get often.
<p>
Here's a request header with a referer. It's saying &quot;I
want

User-Agent: hcuBOT/0.2
</pre>
<p>
hcuBOT/0.2 uses the LWP (libwwwperl) perl module which
is a
predefined library of code written by Gisle Aas that
deals with net protocols.
So, to write a bot in C++, for example, you would use
a networking library
by using the include command. The program calls on
functions in these stored
libraries and LWP relieves the programmer (that's me
or you) of sockets
programming. A socket is how you program the net - you
read and write to a
socket like you would read or write to a file except
that it's more complex.
<p>
hcuBOT/0.2 uses LWP::RobotUA. Robot <u>U</u>ser
<u>A</u>gent is an
appropriate module for web robots and is often called
'polite' because
it's careful not to annoy servers. It is 'polite' by
identifying itself to
the server with a contact email address, following the
robots exclusion
standard and by delaying requests to the server. The
delay, however, defaults
to one minute which is far too long for today's
servers.
<p>
Other LWP modules that can be used instead of RobotUA
are LWP::Simple for
'simple' applications, LWP::UserAgent ~ the parent
class of RobotUA which does
not have the polite features ~ and LWPng 'the next
generation' which will
replace LWP. See the lwpcookbook included with lwp for
examples and usage of
lwp.
<p> This is how hcuBOT/0.2 works.
<ul>
<li>You feed hcuBOT/0.2 a url to start at. In the
first request header above,
the starting url was www.oracle.com. <li>hcuBOT/0.2
requested this page as GET
<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.oracle.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.oracle.com/'" tppabs="http://www.oracle.com/" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com</a> <li>and it was retrieved
successfully, RC 200 OK.
<li>hcuBOT/0.2 tests that retrieved document is OK.
<li>hcuBOT/0.2 saves the
document to disk. <li>hcuBOT/0.2 extracts from that
document links to other
documents - these are the links that you would click
on in your browser.
<li>hcuBOT/0.2 makes these links absolute - HTML pages
can have abbreviated hyperlinks.
<li>hcuBOT/0.2 filters - only want HTML. Regular
expressions (regexes) decide which
documents to queue. If you wanted jpgs or zips, you
would change the regex
for jpegs or zips.
<li>hcuBOT/0.2 decides which documents to queue for
retrieval. It
decides on documents within the same domain and not
already queued or
retrieved.
<li>Repeats until stops for some reason.
<li>Local documents are edited to point at each other
</ul>
and that's about the size of it.

Perl is not the only language to write bots.

You can install Linux to your Windoze machine - you
know you want to.

You could try something like this at altavista '+Perl
