reverse engineering</CENTER> <HR><I><CENTER>Well, feel free to add your observations, 

send your experiences, correct and interpolate... I want this to be a good list 

for anybody seeking SPACE on the net... I'll move it very soon inside the 

anonymity section.<BR>And now enjoy Omar's first attempt to 'rationalize' this 

subject...</I><HR>

</CENTER>

This is a list of all the decent free page providers I was able to find

with some serching! If you know of any other (free) providers that are

not listed here (which you probably do), please e-mail <A HREF="mailto:omarj@tin.it">me!</A>

I didn't even bother to list the so called "other goodies", since I believe

that if you found Fravia+'s site, you know enough about the Web to not

need those stupid on page html builders or any of that crap like FrontPage,

Composer and so on. And if you don't know, go search the Web about "html

guide*" and LEARN!
