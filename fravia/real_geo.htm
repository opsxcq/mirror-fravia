<CENTER>Well, this essay is maybe, a little too theorethical: the 

question about <U>what is reality</U> brings us stright into a never ending 

philosophical discussion. I think that exactly as we understand the 

code cracking it, we will, in due time, understand better the reality cracking it.<BR>

That's the reason 

I believe that any reality cracking essay should cut some 

real mustard, that is, I believe that any essay in this section 

should try to tackle one of the (many) EXAMPLES of reality concealing 

(mostly for commercial reasons) that surround us.<BR>

I decided to publish George's theoretical essay nevertheless, because some theory IS 

indeed needed, 

because there are 

many interesting starting points, because I love the phrase "<FONT color=blue>The crackers

are the heroes</FONT>" and, last but not least, because I hope

that curious George will send either a complement to this 

essay (cracking 'real' reality examples, if you will excuse this pun :-) and/or 

other, more targeted and "useful" essays.<BR>

Besides, I agree TOTALLY with the thoughts expressed by 

George accompanyng his essay:

</I></CENTER>

<PRE>

Dear Fravia:



...More than that, "Reality Cracking" can be accomplished 

by anyone with a critical mind.  You don't need hours 

of undisturbed time in front of the computer. You can 

practice your reality cracking skills all day long, 

everyday of your life! And you should, lest you be taken 

advantage of unknowingly...

...Having read all of the Reality Cracking section, and 

a decent amount of the rest, and being fascinated by the 

+ORC enigma, I felt compelled to write an essay that

covers two topics.  First, I discuss reality as a

whole.  Second, I tried to get into +ORC's mind (funny, 

me of all people, probably one who knows least about

him...) and find an overall motive... hope you enjoy!

Why is Reality Cracking Important?<FONT size=+1>

An Essay Attempting to Justify the Relationship

Between Code Cracking and Reality Cracking</FONT>



written by Curious George

</CENTER></PRE>



(Introduction)<BR>

Our view of the world is our own. The particular set of

events that we experience over our lifetimes shapes what 

we see in the world. There are commonalities however.<BR>

They are large reality models that whole nations

subscribe to. There are different models. Some conflict 

with each other. All are subsets of the true Reality. 

We must crack reality.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

(body)<BR>

øWhat is Reality Anyway?<BR>

<BR>

Lets start from the very beginning.  We talk of Reality

Cracking, but we don't really know what reality is, do we?

<BR><BR>

I believe (with lots of other people too, like Plato,

and Orwell to name two) that it is whatever you think it is. 

More specifically, there are the models ("Paradigms") that

define reality for those who subscribe to them. These

Paradigms have two properties:

their strength grows directly with the number of people

subscribing to them, and they

are self reinforcing.<BR>

<BR>

For example, there is the "western culture" paradigm

that the once was centered in

Europe, but now (unfortunately?) has re-centred to the

USA is, and other nations follow

to a greater or lesser extent. The Media (with a

capital "M") both creates/ preaches/

and echoes this reality and the TV-zombies suck it in

and live it. Western Culture and

the Media are just two Paradigms. There are others...

<BR><BR>

<BR>

Some Paradigms to be Aware of

<BR><BR>

Western<BR>

the Media<BR>

Science<BR>

Islam<BR>

Christianity (esp. fundamentalism)<BR>

others...?<BR>

<BR>

#'s 2, 3, and 5 all are aspects of 1. I list these as

separate, because for some people

they are strong enough to become the principle model of

reality with the others simply

being general cultural factors. i.e. a MD has the

strongest affinity for 3, and 1 contains

2 and 5 for him. A reporter on the other hand has the

strongest affinity for 2, and 1

contains for him 3 and 5.<BR>



<BR><BR>

On That Elitist Group Who Declare to be Truth Seekers

<BR><BR>

What is "news?"

<BR><BR>

Most of it is FICTION believe it or not. You know all

of those "scientific" discoveries

/polls/etc. that They cite? Most of them are

observations (correlational) rather than

experimental (cause/effect) and they haven't been

confirmed yet (and probably never

will be). Also, the reporters are forced (through no

fault of their own) to pick and

choose what they report, which is determined by what

they are interested in, and what they

are interested in is what they believe, and they

believe the news that they hear...so the

set of what the Media reports is a biased sample of the

true set of what is actually

happening. Then we get to the problem of humans'

inability to write objectively, as well as

the dominant "view of the self," (60's American

political liberalism mixed in with resurgent

Puritan values stripped of religious significance and a

healthy dose of materialism) an

aspect of the Western Paradigm.

<BR><BR>

Other reasons why news is fiction? Well, forgetting the

objectivity part, reporters

PURPOSELY misrepresent the 'facts'. Yes that's true. I

can't count the number of "moles"

within the Media who've openly admitted this to me. One

particular person related how by

peer pressure the editors select bad photos of some

people and good photos of others,

sometimes completely out of context. They constantly

manipulate the words, images, etc. to

be artificial creations representing their own

opinions, so much that when They are done,

the result is far from what "really" happened...But

many of them don't realize this (but

the especially cynical ones do and continue doing

it...) because they live within the reality

model that They help create and reinforce. They think

that They are being professionals

objectively stating "the Truth". And of course we

started this whole thing asking "what

is reality?" For the people who share the "Western"

paradigm, THE NEWS IS REALITY.

<BR><BR>

(if you didn't see it on TV, it didn't happen. This

isn't on TV. This isn't happening. You

are dreaming. When I say "asparagus" you will wake and

not remember anything that has happened

to you in the last five minutes...)

<BR><BR><BR>



Another One

<BR><BR>

Science is formed on some basic assumptions, and even

though the

scientists can point these assumptions out, they don't

live them. We all know that there

are things in the world that science can't explain

(yet?). Some scientists are so involved

in their model that they, from within the model, claim

that nothing else exists! Well we

know that's absurd. Almost everybody can point to an

unusual experience and say that it

happened, but they are afraid to because it isn't

"normal" and therefore it is wrong.

Religious miracles are one way of interpreting

happenings unexplainable in scientific

terms in an accepted Paradigm. We all know that there

are other things in the Universe

that we haven't begun to understand (at least in a

scientific sense). A "miracle" may be

a freak occurrence; statistically possible, but not

probable...it may be a mistake in one's

perception...such as experiencing REM sleep while

awake..."miracles" can be explained many

ways, one way being in a religious context...even the

most tenacious scientist will admit

that there are things that his theories can't explain

(satisfactorily at least) and that

describing these things with religion is valid at least

until he can "disprove" that

interpretation with scientific findings...take

evolution for example.

<BR><BR>

Some people used to believe that every type of animal

was created simultaneously by God...

now we believe in evolution. Evolution disproved a

literal interpretation of the Bible for

that particular section. (Unless you are a

fundamentalist, in which case you would argue

that science is just a way of viewing the world, and if

it conflicts with what the Bible

says, science is wrong.) Until the theory of evolution

came along, the previous notion was

perfectly valid because they had no evidence to the

contrary.

<BR><BR>

Don't misunderstand me, science is a powerful tool. The

problem is that (at least so far) it

can not describe everything in our world, and people

are so intoxicated with its success thus

far that they begin to think that they indeed have

succeeded in describing everything...

<BR><BR>

We must remember that much of what we have are

THEORIES. Even though we have stuff that works

and is based off of the theories, the fact that the

stuff works doesn't necessarily mean that

the theory is a correct representation of an aspect of

the Universe.

<BR><BR>

Have you ever stopped to marvel at the fact that your

computer actually works? When you consider

all the issues as a whole, it seems that it must be a

ridiculous mistake.  Microprocessors:

the "wires" are so close together and so thin that the

travel of electrons can actually make

the wires start to move...electrons can

jump...transistors don't have nice distinct spikes...

it is more like a curve...when the voltage is reduced,

this problem gets worse.  Then we have

fluctuations in the power source...what about hard

drives? The data is packed so closely on the

platter that it merges together...to bastardize the

problem, a 01110 could end up looking like

1 to the head...the computer must essentially puzzle

out what is really stored there...if you

look at it directly it would look like white

noise...the new HDs will have their very own Pentiums

to deal with this problem...

<BR><BR>

So, if you ask a physicist, he will say that our

computers shouldn't work. But somehow, we've

tricked the Universe into letting us make them...But I

am on a tangent.

 <BR><BR><BR>



An Appeal to Authority

<BR><BR>

I mentioned Plato and Orwell above. Let me support

those assertions.

<BR><BR>

Remember Plato's cave? Suppose there is a person who is

sitting inside a cave and watching

shadows dance on the wall of the cave. This is the only

thing that he can perceive. For that

person, because the shadows form the whole of his

perception, that is Reality. But because

his perception is false and limited, he fails to

realize that just above and behind him there

are other people dancing around a fire which casts

shadows onto the wall below that he is

looking at. This is not a direct support of what I'm

saying, but it is pretty damn close.

Basically he is talking about the Realization that

humans can have that what we see is a

product of what we think we know.

<BR><BR>

In 1984 Orwell explicitly mentioned the Paradigm

concept. In the novel, he constructed a

"giant conspiracy" in which the elite imposed their own

Paradigm on the world. People who

live outside the accepted Paradigms are in powerful

positions...and consequently they have

enemies...anyway, the story takes place a long time

since the conspiracy was implemented.

Basically the story is about the conspiracy's

self-regulation method kicking into effect.

There will always be humans who question, and in this

situation they were betrayed and crushed.

But the "big bad guy" (name?) tells the hero the truth

about the conspiracy right before he is

crushed. The hero learns that life wasn't always like

it is now, and that the whole situation

was constructed to keep the world in stasis. He learns

that occasionally people like him begin

to question Reality, but they are easily discovered by

the Betrayer and his ilk.

<BR><BR>

Anyway, the ideas I present here aren't mine. I've

gleaned them from other writers, etc.

Possibly make take on the issue is new.  There are all

sorts of philosophers who are basically

restating the same thing in different ways...

<BR><BR>

<BR>

On Cracking

<BR><BR>

Below I attempt to unearth an underlying motive for why

+ORC is so interested in Reality

Cracking. Why did he wait for so long before bringing

this topic up?  Why mention it at all

(as opposed to sticking with "pure" cracking)?

<BR><BR>

Shall I be vague and fictionalesque for a moment?<BR>

Enjoy:<BR><BR>



So, there's this website that I've found that's really

wonderful. There are some people who

think like me and they're also computer experts. They

"crack" things...but the cracking thing

isn't the truly special part. Cracking is an awesome

skill, and doing the exercises will

certainly help become a better Reality Cracker in

general, but I've never been one for doing

exercises...so why is this site so great?<BR>

<BR>

Well there's this "entity" who is a master. His amount

of skill demands that he hide himself

thoroughly.  He wants to share his knowledge with

others (lonely to be alone?) so he gets some

students. They are his most advanced and he only talks

to them occasionally and sporadically.<BR>

They don't know who he is. So anyway this entity writes

some tutorials for his students. They

learn and become really good. They create a whole

"virtual" (ack! Media word. :) academy where

they discuss and feed off each other. He is happy with

this but it is taking a life of its own.<BR>

What he really wants to do is get people to think like

him.<BR><BR>



How do I know this? Well he is writing/began to write

letters to his (principal?) students (who

published some of it) where he is talking about the

same stuff. The cracking thing was just a

way to get there. (a necessary way? I don't know.)

<BR><BR>

Why did the master choose cracking? Well computers/

Internet can be viewed as a metaphor for

Reality. Say that what exists on the internet (the set

of Omega) is the true reality. Say that

what we see in the Western Paradigm is what is given to

us through Yahoo, CNN, Micro$oft, and

Pointcast (especially. The whole idea of push

technology is especially revolting). Say that

when one cracks one is performing the act of seeking

the Truth.

<BR><BR>

For example, this web site teaches how to search the

web well, more specifically, it shows the

reader that there are other methods besides www search

engines to do it. It doesn't actually

TEACH you how to search. (that seems to be changing,

however.) Why? Because the author is

struggling with the question of how obvious he should

make his material. He seems to have

settled on the idea of a "brain activity pre-requisite"

but that level isn't defined and thus

it fluctuates depending on what you read.

<BR><BR>

Anyway, the results you get from each different way of

searching the web are like different

Paradigms. They all overlap somewhat and to find

interesting results you perform "set

operations" on the results. The only way this works is

to be outside any particular Paradigm so

that you know that the others that don't overlap with

yours exist at all.

<BR><BR>

Now lets look at cracking more specifically. There are

the creators of the program, there are

the crackers, there are the programs themselves, there

are the protection schemes, and there

are the cracks.

<BR><BR>

Going back to the Orwell example, the programmers are

the conspirators. Their program is the

Paradigm. Their protection method is the

self-regulation scheme (thought police). The crackers

are the heroes. The cracks are what Orwell didn't have;

the heroes were destroyed in his book.

In his world, the heroes started off at a lower level

than the crackers of the academy. The

heroes had to first recognize that there was a Paradigm

at all, then they had to crack it. But

in this situation Orwell created the "uncrackable

protection scheme" and the heroes were crushed

before they began the actual crack.

<BR><BR>

Now back to cracking as a metaphor. Every exercise that

is published, every essay written, and

every strainer is a metaphorical exercise for cracking

a Paradigm. You have to search through

the various programs until you find a new protection

method. Then you use the skills and intuition

that you've developed thus far to crack this new

method. The mentality required to solve these

types of problems is EASILY mapable onto the real

world.

<BR><BR>

IMHO this is why the master chose cracking as the way.

(besides the fact that he is damn good at

it and it is especially appropriate for our

contemporary situation.)

<BR><BR>

<BR>

On Those Who Seek the Truth

<BR><BR>

There are people out there who've completely quit the

mainstream reality model and are living on

the outside. (+ORC being one of them). They actively

try to keep as open as possible, that way

hoping the be in a receptive enough state to get a

glimpse at the "Truth."

<BR><BR>

There are various established Ways to seek the truth

that one may use. Many of the religions

that have become Paradigms in themselves once were

effective ways.  Some still can be, but when

the religion is part of the larger paradigm, it is

pretty hopeless.  Some methods include first

breaking from the Paradigm before seeking the truth

(like Zen monastaries), and others such as

cracking + reality cracking only concern themselves

with breaking away from that Paradigm.

<BR><BR>

Is it built into our natures to be limited so we can't

see it and only catch glimpses and shadows,

or can we actually get the truth? (There are people in

the past who've gotten as far as we can

get, say Buddha, Jesus, the Zen masters...you know, the

founders of the great religions).

<BR><BR>

The true question that (I think) the master is leading

them toward is to tackle the question,

"Is it possible for humans to know the Truth?"

<BR><BR>

So, before beginning on this question, he must first

get his students to  remove the gauze

from their eyes that humanity puts on itself, so that 

they may see with the maximum ability

that humans can see with. It is like when a Zen student

goes to the monastery and the brothers

let him stay and mediate...that is us now, and when the

brothers grant him fellowship, that is

breaking from the paradigm...and when the brother

reaches Zen that is the ultimate goal...for

as we have seen before, all the philosophies and

religions that humans come up with are just

different approaches spawned from that culture/time

which are ways of attempting to reach the

Truth.
