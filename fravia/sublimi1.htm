Felipe's 3 examples of subliminals<BR>(and a small Coke's 

<A href="#addit">addition</A> by Bomber Monkey)</H2>

25 November 1998<BR>



<P>

Here I send you 3 examples of subliminals, I expect to help your

lifes and to help to "disenslave" you . Please notice that the first one

is just information I collected on internet, but the other two were

discovered through my own observation..</CENTER><HR><BR>



1-Windows' logo subliminals

<BR><BR>



The Dark Horse<BR>

The one that most people can see right off the bat is the silhouette of

a dark horse rearing up on the left

side of the Windows 95 logo. If you have the Plus pack CD-ROM, you'll

find this image on that disc

as a file called LOGO.SYS (which, despite its name, is simply a

bitmapped image that can be loaded

and viewed in Paint. Set the horizontal scale to 170% for a proper

aspect ratio.); otherwise, simply

restart Windows 95 to view the title screen.

As further evidence of the horse's existence, a completely different

image of a galloping horse appears

in approximately the same position on the Win95.bmp image (its tail and

rear leg are at the left edge of

the screen; its head is inside the blue rectangle). Coincidence? I

think not. The meaning(s) of this image

are open to interpretation, but the powerful image of a stallion, the

phrase "dark horse" and other studly

associations are all well-known symbols. 

<BR><BR>

Freedom<BR>

While you're looking at the Win95.bmp image, it's worth noting that

there appears to be a large, dark

bird with outstretched wings above and to the right of the logo. Flying

and freedom, we presume, are

the messages here. Or is that a vulture?<BR><BR> 

The Rock Hero<BR>

On the right side of the logo, there is an image that, in one concise

image, manages to conjure up

suggestions of the passion and excitement of rock music, death and

drugs -- all powerful and typical

subliminal images. If you imagine that the upper-right corner of the

Windows logo points to the back of

a guitarist's neck, you can see that the guitarist has curly hair, a

mustache, a clearly visible frilly collar,

and is playing with his head back and his elbow at approximately the

area where the green and the

yellow rectangles meet. With a little more effort, it's not hard to

imagine that this afro-haired,

mustachioed guitar hero could be none other than Seattle-area rock

legend, Jimi Hendrix. The fact that

he's a local (dead) hero only adds to the plausibility of the

rock-hero-tribute theory. Or could "rocking"

and "horse" be related? 

<BR><BR>

Subliminal Sex<BR>

Not convinced about that one, eh? Well, if you're not so sure that the

Microsoft folks would put a

tribute to a local success story in their code, may we direct your

attention to the image of a well-known

logo on the coffee cup in the animated icon file "SBUX.ANI"). 

The largest hidden image is the most obvious and potent symbol of the

bunch. Like all good subliminal

messages (especially those that have already been shown to contain

references to power, drugs and

rock and roll), this one is about SEX. Look above the Win95 logo and

imagine that the blue area

behind it is the left profile of a man's head. Above the upper-left

corner of the logo is the man's cheek

and eye, defined by a dark area about an inch above the upper-left

corner of the logo. Just to the right

of the white bump in the clouds would, of course, be the point where

the forehead and nose meet. His

forehead and hair are defined by the white clouds at the very top of

the screen. At the top-center of the

screen is his sideburn, and to the right of that, his ear. His chin,

therefore, would be at about the point

on-screen between the large red rectangle and the two smaller ones. 

Naturally, this male figure is poised in a classic missionary position

over the figure of a female figure,

her head back (her neck extends from the bottom-left of the logo

through the letter "s" of "Microsoft").

She appears to be laying on a pillow, her "Princess Leia" hair defined

by the white area at the center of

the left edge of the screen. The bridge of her nose, therefore, is seen

from above and to the right of her

head; the bottom of her chin is approximately where the black dots

between the blue and the red areas

of the logo are. That would make the large bump on the right side of

the logo her...well, you figure it

out.<BR>

 The wallpaper file, CLOUDS.BMP has an even more obvious female image

with the light area just

above the center of the screen showing a blonde woman with puckered

lips pressed directly up against

those of a -- omigod! -- a black man! Hmmm. Do you detect a striking

resemblance to...? Naw, it

couldn't be. Could it?<BR>

There's another obvious face in CLOUDS.BMP, too. Look just to the right

of center-screen and you'll

see a man's face, with the eyes and nose in heavy shadow. If you can't

see it, try reducing the

brightness and/or upping the contrast of your screen. 

<BR><BR>











2- SPEED 2 Incentivating sex with children (I don¥t know the exact name

in English)

<BR><BR>

You must be questioning yourselfs why the hack they would do it. I

don¥t know, but I¥m sure they did it.

<BR><BR>

First of all there is the mute girl that comunicates with the good guy

and shows interest on him. After that she  appears on scenes showing

too much of their body, for a girl (I¥m sorry that I could watch the

movie only once, so I cant remember the scenes  very well, but I

remember that there was one in the elevator). And after that all,

Sandra Bullock (I think that was her) is watching Lolita in her T.V set.

Could you feel the conections? Isn¥t it strange?

<BR><BR>

I would really like if specialist could explain me why they did that.





<BR><BR>

3-Tv companies using our reflexes against us

<BR><BR>

Have you ever noticed that when someone yawns, you feel like yawning?

This happens because of what is called motorized empathy, an

involuntary movement that we do, copying others people movements, just

like baby smile as we do.<BR>

This same principle is used by t.v. companies. You knows that programs

when you hear laughs after each stupid joke?<BR>

They do that, because it provocates motorized empathy too. What makes

us feels like laughing, because only listening to the voice activates

our brains. The recent Nobel prize Dario Fo, an italian comic/political 

(very clever) actor, had (and has :-) 

an extraordinary capacity for "passing" a laugh to his audience. Anyone that 

has seen his incredible (reversing spectacle) 'Mistero Buffo' will remember this... 

you just cannot avoid to laugh when somebody more or less in philosofical sintony with you 

(like Dario fo with us and the TV-Sitcom with the zombies :-) 'passes' us a laugh...

<HR size=2><CENTER>Coke's Ice cubes</CENTER><BR>

The new machines that vend exclusively Coca-Cola products depict a

sexy can of Coke sitting in a bed of ice, in the most erotic way

possible.  And I am not joking.

    Look at the pieces of ice on the can.  On a glance, you see

something odd about them: on a wet, red can, the ice is white.  They

should be red.  Look closer.  The ice on top of the can strongly

resembles a voluptous woman, with her hair dangling over the rim.  The

one to the left of the "ca" in "Coca" looks like a topless woman in

jeans with a belt covering her breasts with her arms.  To the right of

the "ol" in "Cola" another piece resembles a couple making out.  The

piece to the right of the "a" looks like a mother with her child, the

piece above and to the right of that looks like a Arnie.  Above the "a"

another piece of ice seems to resemble a comtented man sitting on the

ground (most likely on a grassy hilltop).  The piece on the swirl to the

right of Coca resembles a revolver.  The ice itself contains subtle

suggestions, although they are too subtle to identify individually.

    The point of this: subconsciously, these will be noticed, and Coke

probably hopes that it will associate its product with these images,

carefully chosen so that at least one image will appeal to everyone.

    Or maybe its just me.
