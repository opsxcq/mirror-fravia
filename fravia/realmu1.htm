<BR>

Well, I got Curious George's and Maxine+'s essays almost at the same 

time. As you will see, they pass pretty good together :-)<BR>

Anyway we are only 'warming the 

reversing muscles' at the moment. I hope that each one of these 'paths' will 

develop in a full fledged cracking sector soon or later... and god knows if 

these bastards that manage funds don't deserve to be cracked black and blue!<BR>

Enjoy!

cutting real mustard (another essay by Curious George, 20 February 1998)



Dear Fravia:



   let me disagree somewhat with your complaint about so-called theory. 

Granted my first essay was abstract.  But if one focuses on the other 

extreme, one fails to see the bigger picture.  

Sure, we can identify the fact that "they" use basic psychology in the 

design of the supermarket layout.  Or we can learn about how salesmen use 

body language to their advantage. 

One beneift of looking at these very specific examples of "their" methods 

is we can be quite sure that we're not going off an unsupported tangent. 

We have evidence of what's going on.



Even if we identify all the methods beign employed currently, new ones

are being developed as we speak.  We know that the reason the supermarket was 

designed to be couter clockwise is that it will get us to by more of what we 

don't need.



But if we consider the next level up, braving to veture into the realm of 

speculation, we get a more alarming result. Why do they want us to buy useless 

things? 



So we stay in the habit of buying.  If we never manage to identify what we 

actually need, and stay blinded to it, we will continue to grab junk

off of the shelves.  If we are deluded even more, then they can start

to reduce the quality (and expense of producing) the junk they sell us! 



Eventually, we will be continuously laboring for nothing.



Really, though, the concept of reality cracking isn't new.  We merely uncover 

contemporary examples of what is going on. Do you remember your Communist Manifesto?  

Marx identified the trend of degradation of quality of life long ago.  

Unfortuately I don't have a copy of it laying around here, or I would

support with quotes. Let's see...something like the nature of capitalism is to 

expand into new markets, then as those fill up, more must be extracted from 

existing markets...the slave class of the proletariat is thus driven below 

subsistence levels...



So, in summary, working at the low level is great, but not to the

exclusion of  a higher level understanding.  

If not for that alone, at least for a way to direct your next low level effort.



One note about the essay: in case you're curious about how I came up

with it so fast, it is an issue that I identified a while ago, but hadn't bothered 

to write about.





Best regards,

Curious George

Understanding a new and devious "free offer" scheme.

Good for all readers, no difficulty level.





Follow the Money

The Truth Behind Free, Online Portfolio Trackers



by Curious George

20 february 1998



One approach to reality cracking is to view the world purely in terms of money.  

You ask yourself, how would "they" make money off of this particular situation 

or behavior?

Rest assured, if you think of a way to make money off of something, its already 

been done. 



Another approach is to thoroughly investigate the motives of whatever party you 

are  suspicious of. Both of these, of course, are nothing new. 

Any critical thinker should already do this. The problem is that many people aren't 

critical thinkers... so we have to teach it, giving it the fancy name, "reality 

cracking".



Let's think about one very familiar commercial gimmick: the free offer.  We all 

know about this. It's been around for ages. I play on your greed by dangling a 

juicy carrot in front of your nose. 



I say, "take it, its completely free! No strings attached!" Well, because I

play on your greed, you delude yourself into thinking that that carrot floats 

in the air by itself.

But really, it is tied to a stick that I hold by a string...what I want from you 

in exchange for the carrot is your personal info to flesh out my database. 



That way I can sell it to spammers. 

Everybody knows this, now. We all know that the motives behind any tangible gift 

is marketing info. 

Some of us don't care and sign up anyway. 

Others despise this form of prostitution.



So, I'm still trying to get stuff out of you. I'm tired of simple personal info, 

like associating hobbies with names and addresses. There's no big money left in 

that area. I want to do something much grander.

Today, on the net, there are far more devious tricks that  appeal to the "smarter", 

richer portions of society. 

And this is the choice target audience. These people have money. How did they get 

their money?

First they worked for it. Second, they invested it. 



Aha! There are millions of upper-middle class people who are semi (quasi?) net 

literate. 

I can manipulate them by the dangerous little bit of knowledge they have.  

They want to be cool, modern, net savvy. 

Another trait is that they care about money.  Many of these people spend their 

free time trying to get more money by speculation. It takes dedication and skill 

to become a great investor, however. 

Most of the volume that is traded on the markets daily comes from little bitty

transactions by these millions of people.  

The big swings in the market are determined by a critical mass of these people 

acting together like lemmings.



So, one could make money out of this, no? I could create an online service where 

people pay to have access to real-time stock quotes and can circumvent expensive 

brokers. 

That would make most of wall street very very mad. It would put lots of powerful 

people out of business. 

Instead I can offer delayed quotes, enough that the people on the floor still have 

an advantage over the individual. 

I can't let Joe average have the same power over the market that I do.



But I can gain more power can't I? This is what I do: create an online service 

that offers some benefit to the individual but not so much that it begins to erode 

my power...enough that he will be motivated to use it despite his suspicion of the 

"free offer". 



I can't charge him because there isn't all that much content in what I offer. 

I get him to submit his portfolio to us so that I can give him the results back...



But, what do I have now? Thousands of Joes and Janes have joined my service! 

I know what a sample of the lemmings on the market are doing! If my sample grows 

enough (admittely a big if), I can watch as the herd begins to move in a direction... 

say there are rumors about the fed changing interest rates. 

People start getting nervous. 

They start to hedge. This feeling begins to spread. 

I can see all of this because I have the dirt on what the lemmings own. 

I can watch transactions take place (they do it through me).  

I can act accordingly. Bet downside, whatever. I can control -to a little extent- 

the market!  I can buy, supply a rumor, then watch as the lemmings begin

to move on it.



Large brokerage firms already have this power and use it. What we see

here is smaller companies trying to grab some of this power with new technology.  

Micro$oft is doing it. Infoseek is as well. On my web search on this matter, I found 

several dozen services that are almost identical.  

More interesting, A company called Reality Online supplies contracts with BOTH MS 

and Reuters!



Below is a excerpt from one site. The sales pitch could be from any

one of the sites. Notice the keywords:

"couple minutes", "simple", "hassle, pain free", "FREE!", etc.  

This particular site is especially noticeable because the propaganda man wasn't 

very creative with his prose. 

Visit the MS site for a much smoother pitch.

Its all about functionality and service to the user (as opposed to an overt push).

So, we've seen that as a result of new technology there is a push by

smaller players into the big boy's pond. 

The world of super money is all about gaining control of the markets.

Nations do it. Super wealthy companies and savvy investors like Warren 

Buffet do it.  Now Bill wants to do it too.



If we extrapolate to the next level, we see that big money is all

about the few super powers vying against  each other. They make a move 

to bump the market in one direction to hurt their enemy's holdings...but 

theyr enemy responds with another move.  This giant game of intrigue 

is what we think is a free market. 



I can almost guarantee this: Direct access to buying and selling will

never happen for the individual investor.  The whole power structure 

would topple if that happened. 



Now, because I am a big picture guy, I will put a bit of "theoretical

junk" in my conclusion.  The concept of free market capitalism is a Paradigm.

They, those in power, want us lemmings to believe that what goes on

is totally random.  Theyr system is too big and complex to be controlled. 

We could never model it.  



As we have seen, that is not what is actually happening.  There are a few big

powers who fight each other for dominance in the world of big money. Each has 

tremendous influence over an aspect of the global market, but not enough

to truly dominate.  Wherever somebody looses money, somebody else makes it. 

But, now we have stepped outside the Paradigm. 

What presumptuous lemmings we are!

<FONT size=+2>The truth behind the fund managers</FONT>

by Maxine+

20 february 1998</CENTER>



Darts beat fund managers



Stock markets boom and crash, like roulettes. In recent years, they have 

boomed very nicely, a fact that for sure has quite a lot to do with 

the disappearance of the only existing, if abysmal, alternative to this 

awful society (the doomed poor Soviet Union) and the consequent immediate 

nuking of everything the working classes all over the world had ever 

gained, from social insurances to free schools, a process eufemistically 

called 'globalisation': letting gullible people believe that it is 'correct' 

and 'a natural trend' that they have to work more (if they ever happen to 

get a job in the first place) in order to be paid less.



But I don't want here to simply denigrate globalisation (that would be 

a much too easy task for a reality reverse engineer, like red-cross 

shooting ;) I want to show you some 'hidden truths' behind fund management 

practiques. And, quite interestingly, I believe, I will DEMONSTRATE these 

same truths right now.



Proceed to a little experiment.

Take the wall street index (the page with all the shares, most newspapers 

publish this roulette wheel every day), now carefully pin it to your wand 

and throw 10 darts at it (great fun). Put inside your spreadsheet those 

10 'pseudo-random' actions. Now choose the ten 'best' fund managements you 

know of (or copy them from "Money" magazine). Get their relative performance 

indexes. 

Put them inside your spreadsheet as well. Get the dow jones and the standard 

and poor indexes as well (to check).



Now comes the interesting part.



Follow boom and crashes for a couple of months. Compare the results. Your 

pseudo-random actions will have OUTPERFORMED more than 50% of the fund 

managers guru. You don't believe it. Try it again. If you still don't

believe it, try it again until you do.



Why this happens. 



Most people believe that when they turn their money to a fund, it will 

grow by leaps and bounds or shrink depending on the market savvy of the 

fund manager.

A 'good' fund will rise faster than the indexes, or, conversely, fall 

less than the indexes when the indexes fall (decaying more slowly).

Now the simple truth is that the number of funds that outperform the 

market is, in average, INFERIOR to the number of casual packed group 

of shares that outperform the market. I repeat: a very stupid fund 

manager can very easily loose MORE than the market average, the best 

fund managers will never do (in average) as well as your darts. That's 

because your darts are (more or less) random. And, as strange as it 

may seem to you, the market is not a perfect-oiled well working 

machine, it is a crazy and silly roulette (which is also tricked and 

jammed in order to shift money from little to big and very big 

shareholders, among other things also through the funds themselves). 



Given their abysmal performances, the fund managers would probably 

like a lot to throw some darts themselves, and renounce to any 

preposterous and totally useless market analysis, since such analysis 

do not make any sense at all (else you would have many more fond 

performances that outperform the market, and not LESS than the 

statistical average ;)



Alas the behaviour of fund managers, far from being random, is watched 

and analyzed by hundred of little lemmings shareholders. It's a 

society build on lies, but it helds pretty tight. This is, of 

course their ultimate doom. Even in a booming market they will loose 

something. As soon as the rollercoast goes down (which has already 

started in July 1997) this will nuke them.

Curiously, the simple truth that MOST funds perform LESS than the 

statistical average does not bother the 'little guy' in the least, 

and they will lie awake at night lulled by the fund managers frill 

heavy presentation advertisement, wondering how the 'successful' ones 

manage it. But, as I told you (and as you can quickly check) the number of 

'successful' fund managers is statistically inferior to the average 

do-it-yourself shares packet. 

Therefore your chances with darts are MUCH better than your chances with 

fund managers.



You don't believe me? Try it, a spreadsheet run won't cost you no money 

at all and will be, I believe, VERY instructive.
