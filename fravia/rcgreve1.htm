10. Reversing Engineer of W95 itself<HR> 

        			INTRODUCTION



	I have been thinking for a long time how to write

this document, because I would want it very easy to

follow, and of course, so that you may take profit of it.



	This doc deals with i386 and above architecture, and

is the first step to understand how all the OS based on this

kind of processors work (and specially W95).

	There are a lot of places where you can find info about

this, but my personal experience is that this information is

not very useful, because the writer has most of the time another 

point of view, quite different from our. For example we don't want 

to enter, nor exit, from PM because we don't want to write a 

program (quite the countrary, we want to &quot;reconstruct&quot; programs, 

and Windoze will do it for us if needs be (this doesn't mean we 

do not want to learn it, it means that our accents are different.



	We will use WinIce to learn, just like I did on my

Amiga with Action Replay: I learned assembler on my Amiga

modifying my favourite games, working with running programs

and modify them. Try everything you imagine, and when you

have all understood make your own program using all the new 

things you have learnt.



	My initial idea was to write about VxD, but due to

the scarce information (and the absolute MS dependence) I

think the best solution is to analize how W95 works and create

your own utilities working with full privileges. 

	To make this, we must understand first of all how our

processor works and then take profit of it (for cracking or

for protecting purposes, it amounts to the same :-)<HR>



				FIRST STEP	





	And now a little theory, don't worry, only a little.



	These 'new' processors support via hardware  

multitasking, that is a 'grossomodo' way to run more than one

program at the same time with a single processor... different 

tasks must run sequentially each for a short time, so to our eyes, 

these tasks will <U>seem</U> to run simultaneously.

	Other new features are the new memory management, 

the hardware debugging, and some other features that we will 

analyze later. 



	One of the problems associated to this is that task one 

can modify (maliciously or unvolontarly) the code or the data of 

task two.

	To solve this problem, the CPU has some protection mechanisms.



	Basically the protections mechanims deals with the 

privilege levels. When you enter at Protected Mode, you

must create a table (GDT), where you will assign to every 

selector (part of memory) differents characteristics.



	A selector is for example this: CS=28 (like W95)

then in the GDT (Global Descriptor Table) you will say for

example that the Selector 28 is the memory between 00000000

and 00003000, where we will put Code working at privilege 

level 2 (with some other characteristics). Think of that

like if it were a Real Mode Segment, but with the limit of 4Gb 

(not only 64Kb) and with some attributes, like if it is data

or code, or if it can be modified or not ...

	So, we must define some selectors and their attributes,

minimum for the Data, Code, Stack and some others.

	

	Let's see that in real life:



Fire Winice and then write:



	GDT



	you will see more or less these lines:





GDTbase=C011E37C   Limit=01F7

and more...





	Let's first intruduce some important new registers

and structures.



	Registers:



	There are 4 new ( called control) registers, named

CR0, CR1, CR2 and CR3.



	CR0: Machine Control Register (bits important for us)



	bit #15: Pagind enabled (memory control)

	bit #0: Protected Mode Enabling (1=enabled)

	

	CR1: Not used (at least in the i486)

	

	CR2: Page Fault Linear Address Register



	Holds the 32-bit linear address that caused the page

fault.



	CR3: Page Directory Base Address Register (more later)



	bits #31-12: Page Directory Base Register





	New flags register called EFLAGS (Extended Flags)



	bit #17: Virtual V86 mode (1=V86 mode)

	bit #16: Resume Flag

	bit #14: Nested Task

	bit #12-13: Input/Output Privilege level

	

	



	Debug Registers (DR0-DR7)



	System Address Registers (GDTR, IDTR, LDTR, TR).

	Now try at your own to get the same values that 

WinIce gives us. How?



	Write GDT, and if it says GDTbase=C0113E7C, then

E C0113E7C, ah!!! by the way the first entry (selector 0)

must be all zeroes.



	All Ok?.....Let's continue.......





	GDTbase is the memory location of the GDT table, and

can be obtained using:



		lea 	esi,_64bitbuffer

		sgdt	fword [esi]		;Store GDT at [esi]



	This can be done only if your descriptor code segment

is running at privilege level 0.



		Segment Selector Format:



	bit #0-1:RPL (Requested Privilege Level)

	bit #2: Table Indicator

	bit #3-15:Index



	CS=28h ==&gt; 101000b (Kernel)



		Index = 101 =&gt; 5 (Entry number 5)

		Table Indicator = 0 (Global Table)

		Privilege Level = 0			



	CS=137h ==&gt; 100110111b (Aplication Programms)



		Index = 26h = 38

		Table Indicator = 1 (Local Table)

		Privilege Level = 3 (Opps!!!)

	



	You can see how W95 assigns to our programs, the

lowest privilege level (3), this is in order that our

programs don't affect seriously the OS, because we

have some restrictions.



	Restrictions the i486 has:



	* Some instructions are disabled, i.e. sgdt., 

and can be executed only at level 0.



	* Data or Code from a higher priv. level

cannot be read nor modified.  



	* Code from a lower level can't jump directly

to a higher level.

	

	* Every Segment Descriptor has a limit, so if

an aplication tries to write outside of the limits,

then the processor generate an exception (which will 

be intercepted by the OS, which in turn will perform 

some operations to solve the problem).



	* The Stack Selector must have exactly the

same Privilege Level than the CS Selector.



	* There is one exception to these rules, you

could see that the Executable Descriptor can be

marked as a Conforming, this means that you can

load this Selector in the DATA segment register

without any restriction. 



	At this time you can be asking yourself how

an aplication (level 3) can execute the OS funtions

(level 0) if you can't jump to them.



	But, before answering this question, let's analyze

first the memory addressing.<HR>



				MEMORY ADDRESSING





	There are three concepts you must undertand first of all:



		1. Logical Address

		2. Linear Address

		3. Physical Address





	Physical memory is the 'real' address, the number that the

processor puts in the bus to access a data in memory, so the

interrupt table is always at the beginning of the memory at 0, so 

if the CPU wants access to this memory location, it must put 0 on 

the address BUS to read the value stored in it.	Another example,

the video memory is at A0000, so the CPU puts that value on the

BUS.



	Obviously, the best way to access memory is putting directly

this value into a register and get the value stored in it, this is

the way Motorola processors work, yet Intel's do not work this way.

	x86 processors combine a segment register with an offsset to

obtain the physical address, this is the solution they took in 16

bits processors times... now that the registers are 32bit long

this way is obsolete, but Intel decided to prserve continuity with 

the past manteining compatibility with the old DOS programms, 

so in Protected Mode the segment:offset method is used too, but 

in a different way.





	Logical address is the combination between segment:offset,

for example if you have a GDT like this:





 Sel     Type         Base         Limit    DPL Attributes

0008    Data32      00000000     FFFFFFFF    0    P   RW

0010    Data32      000A0000     0000FFFF    0    P   RW

..

..



	if you want to read the video memory, you can do it in two ways:



		mov ax,08h	

		mov es,ax	;Selector 8

		mov ax,es:[A0000]



	or:

		mov ax,10h

		mov es,ax	;Selector 10h

		mov ax,es:[0]

 

	In both examples, es:[????????] is the logical address,

and after translating it through the Descriptor Table, we get

the Linear address:



	In the first example:



	Linear Address = Base of Selector 8 + offset =&gt;

							 0+A0000 = A0000



	In the second:



	Linear Address = Base of Selector 10h + offset =&gt;

							 A0000+0 = A0000

 

	After that, x86 have two ways to translate a linear 

address into a physical address, checking bit 31 of CR0

register, the CPU knows if it is in Segment or in Paging

mode (W95 works in Paging mode).

	If the mode is Segmentation, the the Phys. Add. is the

Linear Add., but if we are in Paging mode, the CPU will made

another translation.





	PAGING TRANSLATION



	This mode is a way to manage memory though an index, just

supose you have a very big library, and when you want read a

book, you go to your book index and look where it is stored, and

then go to your library and pick up it. Now, you lost one book, 

and buy another different, then simply you store the new book in

the hollow location of the other one and write down in the index 

the new book location, this is a good way to exploit the library 

space without wastes.



	Well, the i486 books (pages) are 4Kb long, so if

theoretically we can address up to 4Gb, we need a 4Gb/4Kb=1Mb of

indexes if each is 4 bytes long, our index will be 4Mb long, that

is too much for us, we can't waste as much as this.



	So, the solution is create a new index only when really 

necessary, so we can have a main index and a secondary index,

so long as the secondary index is not full we don't create a new 

main index (let's better understand it with an example).



	Linear Address in paging mode has the following meaning:



		Bit31-22: Directory Entry (Main index)

		Bit21-12: Page Entry (Secondary Index)

		Bit11-00: Offset





	The Page Entry format is:



		Bit31-12: Page Address

		Bit11-09: Available for the OS

		Bit08-07: Must be 00	

		Bit6: Dirty (Page has been modified)

		Bit5: Accessed

		Bit04-03: Must be 00

		Bit2: User (0) /Supervisor (1)

		Bit1: Read/Write (1) or Read (0) 

		Bit0: Present





	The physical address of the Page Directory is stored

in the CR3 register.



	Suppose that our CR3 register reads 5DE000h.



	So if our linear address is: 

		403499 ====&gt; 10000000011010011001b



		Directory Entry = 1h

		Page Entry = 3h

		Offset = 499h



Phys. Add.	Data stored in memory (remember that are inverted)	 

5DE000   		67,C2,00,C0 (0)

5DE004		67,C2,55,C9 (1)

5DE008   		   .. 

..		   	   ..

..		   	   ..

5DEFFC	   	   ..   (4095)



	Directory Entry 1 is: C955C267 ('uninverted')



	Physical Page Address is: C955C000  (4Kb aligned)

	Attributes are: 267h = 001 00 11 00 111 

				    

	OS flag=001

	Dirty=1

	Accessed=1

	User=1

	Read/Write=1

	Present=1



	W95 define the OS flag as:



		000=VM

		001=System

		010=Reserved

		011=Private

		100=Reserved

		101=Relock

		110=Instance

		111=Hooked

	

Phys. Add.	Data stored in memory (remember that are inverted)	 

C955C000   		67,C2,30,C2 (0)

C955C004		67,C2,25,C4 (1)

C955C008   		   .. 

C955C010	   	67,C2,34,C3 (3)  

..                   ..

..                   ..

..		   	   ..

C955CFFC	   	   ..   (4095)





	Page Entry 3 is: C425C267 ('uninverted')



	Physical Page Address is: C425C000  (4Kb aligned)

	Attributes are: 267h = 001 00 11 00 111 



	And finally if we add the offset to the Phys. Add. we

obtain the desired value:



	Phys. Add. = C425C000+499h=C425C499



	Remember that a page is only 4Kb long.





	And now, think a little and answer these questions?



	Why all the W95 programs are executed with:



		CS= 137h

		EIP= 401000-7FFFFF range ?



	Does this fact mean that all the programs are in the

	same physical memory location (very illogical)?



	Answer:



	137h=100110111b ==&gt;



			Selector Index=26h

			Table Indicator=1 (Local Table)

			DPL=3 (Lowest privilege level)



	Windows uses Paging mode, so the linear address of

137:401000 mean:



		Directory Entry = 1h

		Page Entry = 1h

		Offset = 000h



	When paging is enabled, a task can only have one page

directory table but several second level page tables.

	So to perform a task swap, W95 only needs to modify

the page directory second entry (1h) to point to the new

task physical address, but to our eyes all tasks are running

at the same linear address.	





	Note that a program has a consecutive linear address,

but not necessary consecutive physical address, for example:



		cs:401FFA 	cmp 	eax,1505h

		cs:402002	jne	402957



	the first instruction can be at C734FFA phys. address and the

second can be at C335002 phys. address, it depends on the second 

table (remember the lost book).



	Finally, if the program accesses a page that is marked

as not present, a fault exception is generated, then the OS

will make the necesary actions (like load it from the exchange

file).



	A practical example: 



	I have used Zmud but you can use other programs or

even windows 95 itself.



	bpx GetLocalTime

	fire zmud



	after a few F11 you will be at:



	137:40749E  E8E3DCFFFF		CALL KERNEL32!GetLocalTime

	137:407499  668B4C240E		MOV CX,[ESP+0E] <HERE 137:40749E 668b54240A MOV DX,[ESP+0A] .. .. Remember: 137h selector base is 0h so the lin. add. is 40799. DIR. PAGE="1" PAGE ENTRY="7"> 7*4=1Ch

	OFFSET=499	



	

	Now type:



	CPU



	and you will obtain:



	EAX= .....

	ESI= .....

	DS = .....



	CR0=8000001B  PE MP .....

	CR2=..

	CR3=005DE000

	..

	..



	for us is only important that we are in Paging Mode, bit31

of CR0 register and the CR3 register, the physical address of the

Directory Page Base.



	Now type:



	phys 5DE000 (obtain the linear address of a phys. add.)



	you will obtain: (I think that is always the same linear

				address, but I'm not too sure)



	C197A000	

	FFBFE000 (Ignore this)



	now type:



	e C197A000 



	you can also obtain this using the peek command.



	Type:



	peek d 5DE000 (for the first entry 0h)

	peek d 5DE004 (for the second entry 1h)



	the answer for the second entry is: (in my case)



	0xC1C267 ===&gt; So the Secondary table phys. add. is:

		

	C12000+1Ch=C1201Ch



	typing again:



	peek d C1201C



	we get:



	0xC1F267 ===&gt; The real phys. add. is:



	C1F000+offset (499h) = C1F499h



	typing finally:



	peek d C1F499:



	0x244C8B66



	that corresponds to the opcodes of our actual eip.



	

	Last question, if W95 operates in Paging Mode, How

Sice obtain the value stored in memory if we give it a

phys. address, remember that the CPU transforms the value

to a phys. address, reading CR3 register we obtain a phys.

address, but how we can transform it to a linear add. if

we don't know where is the directory table?



	I thpought about this for a while, then I tried the following:



	Fire Sice when it executes a ring0 code, then put

these instructions and execute them:



		mov	eax,CR0

		mov	esi,CR3

		and   eax,7fffffff	;Segment Mode

		mov	CR0,eax

		mov	ebx,[esi]	;Now it is the phys. add.

					;because we are in seg. mode

		or 	ax,80000000

		mov	CR0,eax		;Paging Mode



	the result was a miserable crash, why?

	

	Because in the inst. next to the mode change EIP

points to a unexpected memory location so the inst.

executed wasn't the mov ebx,[esi].



	I think that Sice has part of it code in the Conventional

memory, so if you change from Paging to Segment Mode, the memory

location is the same, so it don't crash.....do you agree with

me? Do you know the correct answer? Do you have other ideas?<HR>



				CONTROL TRANSFERS

	

	There are three kinds of control transfers:



	1. From one privilege level to another in the same task.

	2. From one task to another (not necesary at the

       same privilege level, Windows95 does not use it).

	3. From PM to V86 mode (or viceversa).





	Remember that each privilege level in one task

must have its own stack segment with the same privilege

level.





	TRANSFERS BETWEEN DIFFERENT LEVELS IN THE SAME TASK



	A task has four levels, every one of them is independent

from the others. Each level must define its own Stack and Code

segments. Any transfer that changes the CPL (current privilege

level) must change the the privilege level of the stack at

the same time.



	HIGHER TO LOWER LEVEL



	Every time the OS gives control to an application, this transfer 

does not check the privilege levels. Note that CS and SS must 

be loaded at the same time! To be able to make this, we store 

in the stack the SS,ESP,CS and EIP and then with the RETF and IRET

we give control to the lower level code (remember that these

instructions load the registers at the same time).



	LOWER TO HIGHER LEVEL



	An application needs to execute OS Code, this transfer

is dangerous for the integrity of the OS, so it must be

controlled, How? Using the GATE Descriptors, these descriptors

points directely to a function of the OS (see the GATE

descriptor format) that 'regains' the control.

	The GATE can be a Interrupt Gate, a Task Gate, or

a Call Gate. W95 uses the Interrupt GATE, so any time that

an application wants to return control to the OS (or

execute part of its code) it will execute a GATE Interrupt

(W95 uses Int. 30).

Understanding Transitions From Ring-3 to Ring-0



Many times when tracing into code, under Windows 95,

you arrive at either an INT 0x30 or an ARPL. Both are

methods for making a transition from Ring-3 to Ring-0.

When you wish to follow the ring transition, you can

save yourself the time and effort of stepping through a

large amount of VMM code by using the G(o) command to

execute up to the address shown in the disassembly.

Windows 95 uses the following methods to transition

Ring-3 code to Ring-0 code:



&127; For V86 code, Windows 95 uses the ARPL instruction,

which causes an invalid opcode fault. The invalid opcode

handler then passes control to the appropriate VxD.

The ARPL instruction is usually in ROM. Windows 95 uses

only one ARPL and it varies the V86 segment:offset to 

indicate different VxD addresses. For example, if the

ARPL is at FFFF:0, Windows 95 uses the addresses FFFF:0,

FFFE:10, FFFD:20, FFFC:30 and so on.

The following example shows sample output for

disassembling an ARPL:

FDD2:220D ARPL DI,BP ; #0028:C0078CC9 IFSMgr(01)+0511





&127; For PM code, Windows 95 uses interrupt 0x30h. Segment

0x3B contains nothing but interrupt 0x30 instructions,

each of which transfers control to a VxD.



The following example shows sample output for

disassembling segment:offset 3B:31A:



003B:031A INT30 ; #0028:C008D4F4 VPICD(01)+0A98

003B:031C INT30 ; #0028:C007F120 IOS(01)+0648

003B:031E INT30 ; #0028:C02C37FC VMOUSE(03))00F0

003B:0320 INT30 ; #0028:C02C37FC VMOUSE(03))00F0

003B:0322 INT30 ; #0028:C023B022 BIOSXLAT(05)=0022

003B:0324 INT30 ; #0028:C230F98 BIOSXLAT(04)=0008

003B:0326 INT30 ; #0028:C023127C BIOSXLAT(04)=02EC



------------------------------------------------------	

	



	W95 gets the Return address after the Int. and

using it with a table gets the VxD entry function.



	

	Exception to this is the Code Segment marked

as CONFORMING, so if you make a JUMP/CALL to this

king of Segment, the CPU reacts giving this Segment 

the same privilege level of the Caller (and executes 

the Code without problems).



			INTERRUPTIONS/EXCEPTIONS



	In PM interrupts and exceptions are used as a

control-transfer methods.

	Exceptions are generated by the CPU during the

execution of an instruction.

	There are maskable/unmaskable  interrupts. 

Unmaskable can be enabled/disabled using the EFLAGS

register (IF=0 means that the int. will not occur).

	Maskable int. are Ints. from 0-20h.

	Unmaskable from 21h-0FFh.



	As the same maner as the GDT, there are an 

Interrupt Descritor Table (IDT) where the CPU will

get the Code it must execute and if can be done (it

depens on the DPL assigned).



	Using SoftIce write IDT and:



Int   Type   Sel:Offset Attributes Symbol/Owner

IDTbase=C000ABBC Limit=02FF

0000 IntG32 0028:C0001200 DPL=0 P VMM(01)+0200

0001 IntG32 0028:C0001210 DPL=3 P VMM(01)+0210

0002 IntG32 0028:C00EEDFC DPL=0 P VTBS(01)+1D04

0003 IntG32 0028:C0001220 DPL=3 P VMM(01)+0220

0004 IntG32 0028:C0001230 DPL=3 P VMM(01)+0230

0005 IntG32 0028:C0001240 DPL=3 P VMM(01)+0240

0006 IntG32 0028:C0001250 DPL=0 P VMM(01)+0250

0007 IntG32 0028:C0001260 DPL=0 P VMM(01)+0260

0008 TaskG  0068:00000000 DPL=0 P

0009 IntG32 0028:C000126C DPL=0 P VMM(01)+026C

000A IntG32 0028:C000128C DPL=0 P VMM(01)+028C

..

..

..

0030 IntG32 0028:C001B04  DPL=3 P Alloc_PM_Call_Back+4E

..

..





	Now see how the Int. 30 can be called by

applications at level 3 (if you modify and put

DPL=0 Windows 95 will crash due to Protecting Problems,

try it!!!!).



	How?



	IDTbase=C000ABBC, so E C000ABBC+(30*8)



	Now change the EE with 8E, again IDT and you

will see Int. 30 DPL=0.



	x



	and ...... W95 crash inmediately.

	



	Because Int./Exc. can occur at any time and the

DPL is unpredictable, it is necessary to avoid this 

situation... there are two possible solutions: putting the 

handler at level 0 or in a CONFORMING Code Segment.

	After entering to the handler, the stack contain

the next registers:



	No Priv. Level Change  		Priv. Level Change



		old eflags				old ss

		old cs				    old esp

		old eip				    old eflags

		error code				old cs

							    old eip

							    error code



	because when there is a level change, the CPU changes 

the stack selector according to the level (this information

is stored in the TSS segment of the current task, (look at 

the next chapter).

	bit #3-31: Undefined.<HR>





			HARDWARE MULTITASKING	





	Multitasking is suported via Hardware directly

(although W95 does not use it, due to speed problems),

but how?



	Well in our GDT we can define TSS Descriptors,

where the processor will store some important parameters

before the task switch (registers, and some others like

LDT, CR3...).





	The Task State Segment (TSS) format is:



	byte #00-01: Back Link to previous TSS

	byte #02-03: Reserved

	byte #04-07: ESP0

	byte #08-09: SS0

	byte #10-11: Reserved 

	byte #12-15: ESP1

	byte #16-17: SS1

	byte #18-19: Reserved 

	byte #20-23: ESP2

	byte #24-25: SS2

	byte #26-27: Reserved

	byte #28-31: CR3

	byte #32-35: EIP

	byte #36-39: EFLAGS

	byte #40-43: EAX

	byte #44-47: ECX

	byte #48-51: EDX

	byte #52-55: EBX

	byte #56-59: ESP

	byte #50-63: EBP

	byte #64-67: ESI

	byte #68-71: EDI

	byte #72-73: ES

	byte #74-75: Reserved

	byte #76-77: CS

	byte #78-79: Reserved

	byte #80-81: SS

	byte #82-83: Reserved

	byte #84-85: DS

	byte #86-87: Reserved

	byte #88-89: FS

	byte #90-91: Reserved

	byte #92-93: GS

	byte #94-95: Reserved

	byte #96-97: LDT

	byte #98-99: Reserved

	byte #100-101: Reserved

	byte #101-102: I/O Map Base  

	



	So if you want to switch between tasks, you must

first load the Task Register (TR) with the current

task segment selector (TSS) and the jmp or call to

the other task segment descriptor.



	mov	ax,task0_TSS_selector

	ltr	ax

	call/jump 	far task1_TSS_selector





	You can create for every task you have a different

Task Selector.
