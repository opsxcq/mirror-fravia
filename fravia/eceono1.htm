<H2>The Economics of Piracy - 1</H2><H3>An interesting email-exchange between<BR>Brandon Van Every

 and Russ Williams<BR>(september 1998)</H3>

<H4>Courtesy of fravia's pages of reverse engineering</H4><HR>

<I>Welcome to the first part of a very interesting email-exchange between 

some 'real' games' programmers. Even if the main concern of these guys is to 

avoid CD-ROM pirating, some of the tricks they are proposing and evaluating 

have quite a relevance for all reverse engineering enthusiasts, as you'll read. I have added very few comments.

<H4>Well, this is a long email-exchange 

between game-programmers. Top game programmers'  

protection techniques are interesting because these guys are under very 

sophisticated attacks from the 'real piracy' industry: i.e. those guys that BURN hundreds 

(thousands?) of pirated CD-ROMs with the latest "hit" in order to steal money. Whole industries 

are active in this sense in Asia and Eastern Europe. 

This activity is not only stealing, it is a "commercial" attitude that we not 

only DO NOT condone, but that we are ready to counter together with these same protectors if 

needs be, for instance delivering our own thoughts on these protection schemes.<BR>On the other hand, these same attacks seem to push these protectors to an higher 

degree of resourceful inventive: unfortunately their main problem is identifying leaks when 

they send CD-ROMs to the magazines for testing, yet part of the schemes that they propose 

could bear interesting fruits in the future for all forms of software protection, CD-ROM 

based or NOT CD-ROM based. That's the reason I have decided to publish this.<BR>

As you will read, there are quite a lot of sound protecting ideas in here, and I can 

only praise the idea of sticking the key "<FONT color=purple>in the 

INDEX STRUCTURE of the data, somewhere that takes  

quite a while to figure out how to transform without breaking 

everything</FONT>. Yes! Yes! This is <U>the way of the future</U> for all kinds of protections, 

and it is, IMO, the only strategy that will work. Once more: "<FONT color=purple>The cracker *has* to solve the structure 

of your data file to break    

the protection scheme.  No other choice.  Has to understand what's a float value, 

what's an index, etc.  And you could make it take a very long time for  

him to do that</FONT>. And exactly that will mark the difference between lam-o-crackers and 

real reversers: real reversers will <U>enjoy</U> this kind of protection! Of course 

we will reverse these schemes, yet it shall -let's hope- take 

some time (like it should be when solving any good puzzle) and this delay will 

serve this kind of protectors well, since by the time we have 

cracked their games' protections, the commercial products themselves 

will already be "oldies". So what? Who cares? Man, I'm myself at this very moment cracking 

in the background  

a very old DOS game just for the fun of it! Who cares if the target is the last frizzy-dizzy 

flop of tomorrow? It's the amount of intelligence that has been put into the protection scheme 

that counts :-)<BR>Let's hope that Brandon and Russ will soon implement some of their 

smart and inventive projects!</H4>

I think that settles the whole pre-release piracy-as-marketing question

right there!  You don't want them reviewing your betas.  Too risky even if

you think your game concept is so good it'll carry the day.

How can that help?  If pirates get wise that you're doing this, then 

they'll just erase the identifying information.  <FONT color=blue>It's 

only if they don't realize that there's identifying information, that 

it would stay put from copy to copy</FONT>.  What you suggest is 

yet-another-way to curb the problem, it doesn't stop the problem.

Actually I have to admit, I find the struggle of piracy vs. 

anti-piracy to be more glamourous than the old virus vs. anti-virus 

struggle.  The former were assholes that made people's lives 

miserable, the latter were creeps with the sense of humor of the 

National Security Administration.  At least with piracy, it's somewhat 

like Monopoly money in a lot of instances, even if there are real 

dollars in there too.  Example of glamour: cracking someone's network 

site is generally considered rude-to-criminal behavior, depending on 

what you do once you get in.  But if you crack a pirate's warez

A final comment, now that you know the true nature of my diabolical

I sympathize (can't empathize, it hasn't happened to me yet) with game

developers whose work was ripped off.  But think back to when you were a

kid.  Did you have any warez?  Did you have a special disk that would just

copy anything?  If you did, well then just because you're an adult 

now you can't judge the kids too harshly.  And if you were never like that 

as a kid, all I can tell you is you missed out on a Rite De Passage that 

a lot of others of us have fond rememberances of.  Like toilet papering

   Level 1: a visible "BETA, NOT FOR RELEASE" stamp on an opening or

closing screen with a tag id# ("burn #75").



   Level 2: a different binary on every version released. If you're

doing no more than one burn per day, this is pretty trivial, as the

code *will* change daily during a project. Keep around every binary

you ever shipped out, and when something is stolen, match that binary

to your archived copies-- say the 9/17/98 build of beta test candidate

#8. If someone's able to mix and match functions out of >1 binary on

the fly, then they really should be working for you.



   Level 3: <FONT color=blue>some datastreams in each binary that are randomized. 

All you need is a app_cuid.cpp which has a const unsigned char

appid1={0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef....}  or the like</FONT>. Have a

an odometer or the like) and most people wouldn't know that data       ;a very clever idea

from the rest of your binary.



   Level 4: any ideas?



   Crooks won't know what method(s) you used until possibly *after* a

source is pinpointed and terminated. If you've only got a few possible

leak sources, then you might be able to get around many major leaks

for a project or two.

Since the only purpose of this message is to intimidate, it should say

"BETA, NOT FOR RELEASE. Burn #75 issued to James Cameron of Industrial Death

And Mayhem on August 16, 1998."  Because you *are* going to release only 1

disk per person per company, right?



Hmm, what if some disgruntled worker at Industrial Death And Mayhem doesn't

like James Cameron, or his movie Titanic?  She steals the CD, burns a copy,

then sends it to some piracy ring for processing.  She quits the company,

nobody ever figures out her role.  James Cameron is screwed.  It places a

grave responsibility on him to guard the data, that's for sure!

This works if you send 1 version per person per company, you're not sending

out many versions, and you're sending out versions on very different builds.

If  (N) builds are substantially similar, then a cracker could

hack/obfuscate your code, the obfuscated code will look substantially

similar to (N) different versions of code in your archive, and you won't

know which of (N) people to blame.  And of course if you send out more

versions, you increase (N) and there are more suspects.



For what purposes do you typically release CDs?  Why do these things need to

go out of the building, to let lotsa publishers know your current progress?

I see a problem in that you'll typically want to send out many of the same

CDs to different companies at the same time.  Like a Release Candidate.  If

you do this, then you've violated the uniqueness of the CDs.  And it doesn't

help to send a CD that's 99.9% the same and just change a variable.

Crackers can bust that sort of thing easily, and you won't know who to

blame.



If you're just sending CDs to your 1 publisher to keep them appraised of

your situation, then why isn't it their responsibility when *any* of the CDs

turn up pirated?

And I take it you never ever release the identifier program app_cuid.exe

outside of the building.  Your own in-building security has to be pretty

good, then.  But only as good as preventing someone from taking an unmarked

CD outside the building anyways.



Problem: <FONT color=blue>let's say your secret data is a special triangle in your 3D</FONT>  ;a very clever idea!

<FONT color=blue>dataset</FONT>.  You slightly change the value of the vertices at 

every release, and you scramble the datasets between each release enough 

so that no easy comparisons can be made, i.e. the triangle will never stick 

out like a sore thumb.  A clever cracker thinkz you might have embedded a 

key in your program somewherez, he thinkz itz in your 3D datasetz.  

So he perturbs every single point of data in your dataset by a small   ;need a dedicated C

random amount.  Hey presto, your program still works!  Oh no! the      ;script for that... few

magic key is gone.						       ;reversers would do it.



Same basic drill as [2] above.  First the cracker has to figure out your

spaghetti, i.e. the program structure or data structures of your binary.

Then he has to devise an automated way to transform everything into a

slightly different usable value.  Crackerz are very good at the 1st    

stage already.  It's this new "transformation" stage which will be     ;correct, we need new

a challenge for them for awhile.  But given enough time, they'll come  ;automated scripts for

up with some methods.						       ;this kind of detection.

Who are the usual sources of pre-release leaks, typically?

Surely it's the personal security of the person in charge

of the checks? They can keep it strongly encrypted and

only dig it out when they find a new warez copy of the

program to examine.

Very good plan. I doubt anyone would ever notice that

until it's too late.
