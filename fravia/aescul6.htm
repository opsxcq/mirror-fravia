		   Fido2Int mailer v. 2.00 Key Generator

		 A tough Key File Based Protection Scheme

			      By Aesculapius





	This essay deals with a tough key file based protection scheme. 

Key file based schemes are those, where certain file, containing encrypted 

data unlocks all registered functions of the target program when it is valid 

and present. The name of this file could be different, but the file name 

extension is very frequently the word 'key' (*.key). To defeat these 

schemes, you must first find out which is the name of the valid key file. 

Some String Search utility (as Search and Replace for Windows 95/NT) could 

be used to gather the key file name. Search for the word 'key'. If you can't 

find it, then, load the main executable of the target program in SoftICE and 

set a breakpoint on BPINT 21H IF AH == 3DH (DOS target) or BPX CreateFile, 

BPX ReadFile (Windows target). You could also disassemble the target program 

with wdsm89 and search for relevant phrases: Unregistered, Registered, key, 

etc. Once you have figured out the key file name, it is time to seek the 

target code locations where this file is opened, read, and how this 

information is manipulated. Sometimes, you'll have the great advantage of 

having a valid key file (a legal valid key file or some key file another 

cracker created before you). If this is the case, you can study the key, to 

learn what's inside it, how many bytes are allocated in the key, what happen 

if you modify the key, etc. In this essay we wont have the great advantage 

of having a valid key. We must figure out everything (the key file name, how 

many bytes it has, how the information is stored inside it, the encryption 

process, etc.).



	

	Fido2Int, is a very interesting target, I choose it, because the 

encryption process is extremely clever. It took me more than two hours to 

generate a valid key file. You can find the target program at 

www.terminate.com, the file is 328 Kb long. You'll need the following tools: 

Wdsm89, SoftICE for Windows 95 and TASM 5.0.



	Proceed to disassemble the file with wdsm89. Now search for the 

following word: 'UNREGISTERED'. We land here:

	Pretty obvious, doesn't it? if byte at memory location [0043D868]  

contains 00H then the software is Unregistered, if it contains 01H it is a 

Registered Copy. According to this, appropriate messages are written. 

Patching at this point is so evident that I wont discuss it, however, you 

should notice, that &quot;a patch&quot; is not acceptable in this case, because 

this software objective is to create mail packets that will travel around 

the world, therefore, all packets will contain a 'Registered to: Empty 

space--&gt;Lamer sighted' Sentence!!! Yes, an elegant and massive way to inform 

millions of people that you DIDN'T PAY THE RIGHTS TO USE THIS APP!!!



	At this point, we know that the valid registration flag is stored at 

memory location CS:0043D868 and it will contain 01H if registered, so lets 

search where in the code a 01H is stored in the flag. At wdsm89 search for: 

'[0043D868], 01'. You land inside the key file decryption process itself:

	The Decryption process has ended. We must explain what happened.

	The first 2784 bytes of the key files are XORed with 0FFh. Only 

the last four bytes of the initially encrypted file are not XORed. 

Immediately after this, next 1393 bytes of the key file (which were 

previously XORed with 0FFh) are now XORed with 1393 bytes from the beginning 

of the key file (which were also previously XORed with 0FFh). In other 

words: Byte 1 is XORed with 0FFh, the resulting byte is XORed with byte 1394 

which previously was also XORed with 0FFh, then, byte 2 is XORed with 0FFh, 

the result is XORed with byte 1395 which was previously XORed with 0FFh, and 

so on.



	The process is a little messy but not in anyway impossible to 

defeat, nevertheless, the most important fact of this decryption system is 

(as you probably already noticed) that the magic numbers necessary to 

complete the decryption process are located in the key file itself, which 

off course you wont have. This is a very important concept for the +HCU. 

+ORC refers that the basic weak point of any protection scheme using 

encrypted data is the presence of the decryptor inside the target itself 

(the decryptor must be there because otherwise the program wouldn't be able 

to check if the key file is valid). This could help to revert the encryption 

process. However, in this case, all important data is absent. Lets analyze 

the code a little further when a checksum is finally carried out:

:0042BFA0 C60568D8430001mov byte ptr [0043D868], 01	 ; Yes, Flag= 01 Reg





As you can see, once the key file has been decrypted a checksum is carried 

out with the first 2784 bytes. The result + 221H is stored in EDX. The 

last 2 bytes of the decrypted file (these bytes are not touched in anyway 

during the encryption-decryption process) contain the reference checksum. 

Off course, you cannot know this value until the file is decrypted and you 

cannot decrypt it, because the magic numbers are absent. The decrypted data 

will contain the registration info (Your name, BBS System Name, etc.), 

and all this data will alter the result of the checksum. Tough, ain't it?



	Considering that we will never have access to the magic numbers, 

the following question stabs our mind: How can we open a safe box if we 

don't have the combination?



	This is the solution: If you XOR a byte 00h with 0FFH the result is 

0FFH, if you XOR the result with 0FFH again, you get the original value back 

(0FFH). If you create a key file filled with 00H, the decryption process (if 

you recall) will XOR the first 2784 bytes with 0FFH (so the data is now 

encrypted with 0FFh), from byte 1394 to 2784, XORing 00H with 0FFH will fill 

these bytes with 0FFH, then, the program decrypts again byte 1 with 1394, 2 

with 1395, 3 with 1396 and so on. If the first 1393 bytes were 

initially encrypted with 0FFH, the second attempt will revert the process 

because the last 1393 bytes are filled with 0FFh. The effect is XORing with 

0FFh twice, thereby the encryption system is defeated and the magic numbers 

are no longer necessary.



	Finally a BPX CreateFileA on SoftICE, pressing Ctrl-D twice and 

finally executing d eax, will inform you that the key file name is 

fido2int.key.





	Now, we'll proceed to create our Key Generator ...
